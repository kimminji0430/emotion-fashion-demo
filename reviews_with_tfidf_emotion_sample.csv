A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ,B003Y74AZ2,"Z. Freeman ""Zach""","[1, 2]","First of all - the case I had on my iPhone 4 previously was one of the free ones they give you to alleviate the signal loss issue. I like this one much more. It's a little bit thicker, though not too thick to slide in and out of my pocket. It's a little loose around the sides which can be a bit annoying since it puffs out slightly on either side making it seem like the phone doesn't quite fit snugly enough, but I haven't had any problems with the case slipping off the phone. I mostly like the design - the cutout in the back allows the Apple symbol to show through, which I appreciate, but the hole on the side of the volume buttons is a bit too big. The case I previously had covered those buttons but labeled them on the outside of the case and let you push the buttons through the case.

A30UP2KKD5IQEP,B00BWG4TUI,Soar,"[0, 0]","I am a heavy user of bluetooth headsets. Use the headsets extensively (several hours/day) for work and whenever talking while driving.  I've have tested many bluetooth headsets and currently use thePlantronics Voyager Proheadset.This headset meets and passes my primary requirement... the microphone and speaker quality is good.  Hard to believe how many other headsets can't live up to the basic requirement for microphone/speaker quality.Other notable shining points... the headset fits my ear and is comfortable (once I figured out the process for putting it on, very different than my current headset), the volume is good, I very much like the folding boom to turn off the headset for carrying in my pocket (massive positive that you don't get butt dials this way).  Also, when charging, it is very clear when it is done.Because of the positives, this headset enters the limited category of 2 headsets that I can live with (out of many that I have tried)... this one (the Jabra Motion) and the Plantronics Voyager.I gave the Jabra Motion 4 stars because there are some notable areas for improvement (and didn't give it 3 stars because, even with the annoyances, this is a nice headset... it's just that it can be so much better).Concerns:- Glitches waking up.  While using the headset, if leaving it in my ear without turning it off (folding the boom), it seems to go to sleep.  If I receive a call... it doesn't always wake up properly and answer the call.  I am forced to fold and unfold the boom to reliably pick up a call on my iPhone 4s.- The button on the headset to pickup/hangup/redial is very easy to bump when adjusting the headset in my ear.  I got tired of thinking ""arrrgh, I did it again"" when adjusting the headset- Volume control is gimmicky.  It is a touch sensor that I did not like at all.  My hair would constantly get it the way of using it.- Mobile app for the phone... limited use, waste of time.  Nothing worse than an app the provides almost no value.Missed Opportunity with the Mobile App:I think Jabra missed an great opportunity with their mobile app for the headset.  The limited use functionality that it has is a waste of time to spend downloading.  However, the opportunity is to add the ability to tweak all kinds of features I would love love LOVE to be able to tweak... for example.  Turn off double-click re-dialing.  That feature is a bane for me... hate it in all headsets and would like it to go away.  So, set a feature in the app to default to it on and let me undo it.  Same thing for other features... give me the ability to set a default power-up volume.  So, if I adjust the volume in a noisy or quiet environment, and later use the headset, it goes back to what I want it to be.  I'm sure with a little thought, a whole slew of options would come to light.  Develop an app that improves my use of this product... be a differentiator versus the waste of time that it is now.",4.0,Good - needs improvement/tweaking,1368403200,"05 13, 2013",i am a heavy user of bluetooth headsets use the headsets extensively several hoursday for work and whenever talking while driving  ive have tested many bluetooth headsets and currently use theplantronics voyager proheadsetthis headset meets and passes my primary requirement the microphone and speaker quality is good  hard to believe how many other headsets cant live up to the basic requirement for microphonespeaker qualityother notable shining points the headset fits my ear and is comfortable once i figured out the process for putting it on very different than my current headset the volume is good i very much like the folding boom to turn off the headset for carrying in my pocket massive positive that you dont get butt dials this way  also when charging it is very clear when it is donebecause of the positives this headset enters the limited category of  headsets that i can live with out of many that i have tried this one the jabra motion and the plantronics voyageri gave the jabra motion  stars because there are some notable areas for improvement and didnt give it  stars because even with the annoyances this is a nice headset its just that it can be so much betterconcerns glitches waking up  while using the headset if leaving it in my ear without turning it off folding the boom it seems to go to sleep  if i receive a call it doesnt always wake up properly and answer the call  i am forced to fold and unfold the boom to reliably pick up a call on my iphone s the button on the headset to pickuphangupredial is very easy to bump when adjusting the headset in my ear  i got tired of thinking arrrgh i did it again when adjusting the headset volume control is gimmicky  it is a touch sensor that i did not like at all  my hair would constantly get it the way of using it mobile app for the phone limited use waste of time  nothing worse than an app the provides almost no valuemissed opportunity with the mobile appi think jabra missed an great opportunity with their mobile app for the headset  the limited use functionality that it has is a waste of time to spend downloading  however the opportunity is to add the ability to tweak all kinds of features i would love love love to be able to tweak for example  turn off doubleclick redialing  that feature is a bane for me hate it in all headsets and would like it to go away  so set a feature in the app to default to it on and let me undo it  same thing for other features give me the ability to set a default powerup volume  so if i adjust the volume in a noisy or quiet environment and later use the headset it goes back to what i want it to be  im sure with a little thought a whole slew of options would come to light  develop an app that improves my use of this product be a differentiator versus the waste of time that it is now,joy,joy

APDUCEIT1KJGA,B00F58MU32,Ricky Bowers,"[0, 0]","I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 and had it protected inside an &#34;Otter Box - Defender&#34; case. I didn't like having to open the bottom of the case every day and trying to fool with inserting the Micro USB charging cable. I started researching the possibility of purchasing a wireless Qi charging pad. There were several to choose from, but my phone also required that I purchase a Wireless Receiver Coil, in order for my phone to &#34;communicate&#34; with the wireless charging pad. The receiver coil is a small &#34;card-like&#34; device that is placed inside the back cover of my Galaxy S4. I kept reading reviews about the thickness of some of the cards causing the back cover to buldge. I definately didn't want that, so I finally settled on the TechMatte Qi Receiver Coil. I also read that the card would or could interfere with the phone's NFC functions. (which is the phone's ability to transfer information between one phone and another by simply touching them together) When the TechMatte Receiver Coil arrived, I took my phone out of the Otter Box, and removed my back from the phone. The Receiver has two small connector pins that connect to the inside of my Galaxy S4 by simply placing the connector pins over the two small contacts on the inside of my phone. The Coil has a piece of removable sticky tape that you remove, which allows the Coil to stick to the top of my battery, thus holding it in place. I then snapped the back, back onto my phone and put it back inside the Otter Box. The Coil is about as thick as a standard business card, and I noticed NO buldge on the back of my phone at all. Once I had everything back together, I placed my phone on the charging pad, and everything worked beautifully! NO MORE USB CABLE FOR CHARGING... I only use the cable now for transferring data. I then met a friend for lunch, and decided to test the NFC function, since she has the same exact phone. I opened a photo, turned on the NFC functions on both phones, touched the phones together, and the photo transferred in about 5 seconds to her phone. Everything worked great. I love the product, and the customer service is great also. I received a couple of emails from Kristin asking how I liked the Receiver Coil, and she also included contact information should I have any concerns, comments, or questions. If your tired of fooling with a USB cable for charging, you will LOVE going wireless. I simply lay my phone on the charging pad, and it beeps, then tells me that wireless charging is now being performed. The charging pad that I purchased will charge thru the Otter Box with no problem whatsoever.

It&#8217;s a pretty simple adapter, with one 2.4A output plugs and three 1A output plugs. The 2.4A output is typically used for larger devices such as tablets which require more power to charge, whereas the 1A outputs are used for things like phones, etc. That being said, it shouldn&#8217;t damage your phone even if you plug it into the 2.4A output plug, since your phone is the device that controls how much power it ultimately receives. It&#8217;s well made, and I haven&#8217;t experienced any safety issues related to it.Onto the device itself&#8211;it&#8217;s a rectangle about the size of your drivers license (a little bit smaller), and there&#8217;s a two pronged plug which you can tuck into the device to make it more compact. Once you plug it in a blue light near the output ports will light up to let you know that there&#8217;s electricity running. It&#8217;s kind of a nifty feature, but it might bother some at night.

A10O1R3NYWFCAJ,B00805SEKK,Robert van der Laan,"[0, 0]","I was not sure whether to apply a screen protector to my new Galaxy S3.  I had a Galaxy S1 for over two years without a screen protector and there were only very minor scratches on that screen (always kept it in a leather holster when not in use).  However, during a recent vacation the S1 screen did not survive a drop on a rocky path during a hike...  I ordered these screen protectors since they had good reviews and the price is very reasonable.  I found the protector easy to apply and I did not do anything else beyond thoroughly cleaning the screen (no compressed air, steamy shower room, etc.).  There are no visible dust particles or air bubbles under the protector. The set comes with a small cleaning cloth and a very useful soft card that allows you to remove any remaining bubbles.  The protector covers the phone display completely, but does not cover the complete front of the phone as observed by others.  This actually suits me fine, since I have a case that slightly wraps around the sides of the phoneShell Holster Combo Case for Samsung Galaxy S3 with Kick-stand (At&t;, Verizon, T-mobile, Us Cellular & Sprint)Overall I am happy with the result: a good compromise between protection and aesthetics.  The protector is visible, but it does not interfere with the feeling of the touch screen or the clarity of the display.  I will see how the protector holds up over time and how if it survives the use with the holster combo, since the phone slides in that holster with the screen towards the holster.One minor negative so far (hence the four stars): there is a narrow edge around the whole of the protector that is a bit lighter, almost like it is lifting from the screen.  It is less than 0.5 mm and only visible in bright light conditions, so not really a problem for me.

A19NP8YYADOOSF,B0097570OS,N. Krumpe,"[61, 67]","Before this 3M projector arrived, I had two main concerns:1) Would it be bright enough?2) Which iPhone apps are compatible?Here is what I found:1) The brightness is quite good.  3M's own specs say this has a brightness of ""up to ANSI 35 lumens"" (from 3M's own specs).  Though this may sound rather low, I found that this projects photos, videos, and text very well when used as recommended.  ""as recommended"" means a diagonal of 10 inches to 60 inches.  Clearly, this is a ""hobby"" type of device.  Don't plan a professional business presentation with this projector.  Keep your expectations reasonable.  In a dimly lit room, with your iPhone projecting on a wall 10 feet away, images and text look good.2) I was afraid that this device would be limited to Apple's own video and photo apps and nothing more.  I was happy to find that it worked with quite a few of my go-to apps.  But, there are some apps which did NOT work with this projector.  So, here are some specifics you might care about (and note that what works may depend on which version of iOS you are running, as well as which version of each app you are running):* Netflix: works under both iOS 5.1 and iOS 6* Hulu Plus: works under both (however, I needed to update the app...an older version of Hulu Plus didn't work)* YouTube: works under iOS 5.1, but NOT under iOS6 (probably due to the fact that Apple kicked YouTube out of its built-in apps, and the downloadable YouTube app does NOT project)* Apple's official Photos and Videos apps: work under both (note that the photo app only works in ""slideshow"" mode, meaning you can't swipe through your pictures...you'll be at the mercy of the slideshow timer)* KeyNote: works under both3M's spec sheet says that this device is for iOS 4 and iOS 5.  However, I have had no trouble using this with iOS 6.There are other reasons to recommend this:* I like that the sleeve can be used as a charger for my iPhone.  In other words, when I don't need to use it as a projector, it can serve as a backup charger instead.  Note that it cannot be used as both a projector and a charger simultaneously.  It's one or the other.* There is a button that allows me to switch among projection modes: a mode for brighter video, a mode for sharper contrast when viewing text, and a mode for preserving battery life by dimming the screen.  3M says this will last for 100 minutes of projecting before needing to be charged.  Though I haven't tested it, I would assume this means ""100 minutes when using the mode that preserves the battery"".* The sleeve holds the phone securely: Once the phone is slid into the sleeve, there is an edge around the sleeve that securely holds the phone in place.  It takes a fair amount of effort to remove the phone.  In other words, once the phone is in the sleeve, you don't have to worry about it sliding out or falling out, regardless of how you hold it.  Keep in mind that this is NOT meant to be a protective sleeve.  I would only leave it in the sleeve when you want to use it as a charger or a projector.All in all, this is a decent projector for the price.  It works with the apps I care about (though not YouTube, but for me that's not a deal breaker).  Interested in showing a video or photos to a small group of people?

It's a little flexible, but it's real tempered glass! I've been using it for a couple of weeks, and here's what I love about it: It feels like the factory glass, not tacky like some screen protectors. It's easy to clean. It came with everything needed to install, including instructions. It also came with button stickers. The only drawback is that the glass &#34;cut&#34; is off just a tad.

AOJA1LC8PN7K1,B007W7PIOW,Jeff Chambers,"[1, 1]","In my opinion the most important characteristic of a Kindle cover is weight.  Readers should be able to hold their kindles with a single hand and adding a protective cover shouldn't diminish the device's ease of use.  The Verso nicely gives you the necessary protection for your kindle and keeps the weight down.  The design is also nice (from my wife's perspective) and the kindle stays snug.  I did however encounter one disappointing result from using the cover - the front section lost its alignment with the back cover so when it's closed the two halves (front and back) don't line up - they've off by about an 1/4 inch or so.  Not a big deal and the problem could certainly have been caused by my wife and I folding the front cover behind the back cover when reading.  Overall this is a solid cover and if you like the design, is a good buy.Tips for using this product:- Don't fold the front cover behind the back cover or you'll risk causing the two halves to permanently mis-align.  This doesn't change the functional value of the cover and is more of an aesthetic issue.Product Strengths:- Excellent workmanship and quality- Light weight, still allows the reader to hold the kindle/cover using a single hand comfortably.- Affordable price and excellent value- Solid attachments for anchoring your kindle into the cover, prevents your kindle from moving around.Product Weaknesses:- None really other than the aforementioned cover alignment issue.Would I Recommend?Yes, if you like the design, this is a great quality cover for the price.Rating Justification:5 stars for high quality manufacturing, 5 stars for value and ease of use, 5 stars for low weight, five stars attachment to kindle, four stars for exterior design - overall 5 stars.",5.0,Light Weight & Solid Quality,1358380800,"01 17, 2013",in my opinion the most important characteristic of a kindle cover is weight  readers should be able to hold their kindles with a single hand and adding a protective cover shouldnt diminish the devices ease of use  the verso nicely gives you the necessary protection for your kindle and keeps the weight down  the design is also nice from my wifes perspective and the kindle stays snug  i did however encounter one disappointing result from using the cover  the front section lost its alignment with the back cover so when its closed the two halves front and back dont line up  theyve off by about an  inch or so  not a big deal and the problem could certainly have been caused by my wife and i folding the front cover behind the back cover when reading  overall this is a solid cover and if you like the design is a good buytips for using this product dont fold the front cover behind the back cover or youll risk causing the two halves to permanently misalign  this doesnt change the functional value of the cover and is more of an aesthetic issueproduct strengths excellent workmanship and quality light weight still allows the reader to hold the kindlecover using a single hand comfortably affordable price and excellent value solid attachments for anchoring your kindle into the cover prevents your kindle from moving aroundproduct weaknesses none really other than the aforementioned cover alignment issuewould i recommendyes if you like the design this is a great quality cover for the pricerating justification stars for high quality manufacturing  stars for value and ease of use  stars for low weight five stars attachment to kindle four stars for exterior design  overall  stars,joy,joy

That being said, it comes with a very thick screen protector, which does NOT contour the edges of the screen very well, and looks terrible.  I am actually surprised they sell it with one because of how bad it looks.The case itself is pretty nice. The buttons are very easy to press.  I tried both Otterbox cases prior to trying this one.  The Otterbox cases are just too big for this phone.  My main complaint about this case is that it rubs the edges of the screen protectors, causing them to start coming off.  I use Zagg screen protectors on all my devices, and this particular case is problematic with rubbing the edges.This case does pick up a bit of dust as well, but not too bad.I will likely be getting rid of this case for that reason, and switching over to the Urban Armor Gear case for the S3.  A friend of mine has it and it is far superior than any case I have seen.  That case also doesn't seem to rub the screen protectors off.UPDATE 9-4-13I went to the Zagg kiosk at the mall and they replaced my original Zagg with the HD version (for a small fee).  There is also a version of the Zagg designed to work with cases like the Incipio and is held away from the edges a bit.  I was pretty happy after that switch.I still bought a UAG case and love it!

A2SGAJWXG65464,B00F2S53FC,Anthony,"[118, 121]","There is truth to the claims that this is not the same charger as the one that comes with the iPad. I just got this today and the two units are definitely different...this one is lighter, has different writing on it [the phrase ""Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China"" is missing from this product even though it does say ""(c) 2010 Apple Inc. All rights reserved."" The electrical information appears to be the same.  I note that the male USB receptacle is mounted in this unit the other way around!  There are some other difference too.I haven't had it long enough to see if the charging performance is the same or roughly the same, but I plan to test this over the next few days.  At least my iPad does charge.  Not sure about the rate of charging or if this is a durable product.Comment: I have a charger for my Nook Color that is rated at 5V and 1.9A (or 9.5W).  The iPad will NOT charge at all with this charger, but it does charge with the unit under review here.  Apple has obviously built some smarts into the iPad and has a fairly tight range of voltage/current that it will accept for charging.I have been using this charger for the last 3 nights to recharge my iPad 2. Even though this is not an Apple product, the price is also not an Apple product price, either.  It seems to work fine for charging my iPad. I will continue to post updates on how this charger performs.  And for those who only want the Apple charger, why not order it from Apple or Best Buy? Apple products always seem to come with Apple prices and not discounted (unless Apple has discounted the product themselves (like they did for the 1st gen iPad recently).Edit:  I have now been using this charger for nearly two weeks.  It works fine.  I'm not giving it 5 stars as the product wording does lead one to believe it is an Apple product.  But the iPad 2 won't tolerate charges can't can't supply the required 2 A @ 5V. This one does and charges my iPad 2 the same rate as the one that came with my iPad.  It's a good bit cheaper, but it hasn't fallen apart and doesn't over heat.Edit2:  I've been using this charger for several months now. Charges my iPad 2 just fine.  It is clearly not the Apple product, but it puts out 5V @ 2.1A and that's what the iPad 2 needs.Edit3: Well, I decided to put a Kill A Watt meter on this unit to see what wattage is is providing compared to the Apple charger. It turns out it is only putting out 6 Watts according to this meter. However, the Apple charger puts out 11 Watts. Now, this is the measurement according to my Kill A Watt meter.  Apparently, it is giving my iPad 2 what it needs to think this is a compatible charger because the iPad 2 chargers, but obviously it is going to charge the unit at a slower rate.  This is definitely NOT even a 10 Watt charger, let alone an Apple charger. Thus, this is indeed a rip-off device, even though I have used it for months to charge my iPad 2.I just noticed that the price of this item has increased, too.  I'm going to write Amazon about this.Edit4: While the product may not be up to par, the seller is apparently of a much higher order.  I was refunded my purchase price for this product.  In the future, I will continue to buy from this seller and they do stand behind what they sell.

A3CG2LLC4VHFDJ,B00IOCH23O,shojus,"[0, 0]","I received (3) screen protectors from Anker as a promotion for offering my UNBIASED review. I will start by saying that I normally do not use plastic screen protectors on my devices cause I have come to really like tempered glass screen protectors for their ability to ""feel"" like real glass and also prevent screen breakage. The only problem with some of the tempered glass screen protectors out there is that they are very thick and add an ugly layer that just does not look right. I decided that I will just go back to the good ol' plastic ones and I was pleasantly surprised by how well these fit my Galaxy S5. The packaging was top notch and included the (3) screen protectors, dust tape and a microfiber cloth. The screen protectors were also protected by a hard paper insert so that the protectors do not get damaged in shipping and that used to be a big issue in the past as I have received many damaged protectors due to the mail man bending them or just damage from handling. I usually get a perfect application by the 2nd screen protector applied, but I had great luck with the fit of the Anker protectors and got it right on my first try and it left ZERO bubbles! I did get a piece of dust trapped underneath but that was easily fixed by using the supplied ""dust tape"" and lifting the protector and re-applying it. The clarity of these are excellent and they feel pretty natural to the touch. I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to protect their screen on the S5 and applaud Anker for producing a great quality product. They have never disappointed me! Feel free to ask any questions and I may be able to be of assistance before purchase. I also left a picture so that you can see the applied screen protectir and what the package comes with.

A1OGCPMSIVK7G4,B0098FKHA6,ocxmichael,"[4, 6]","been using this case for a few weeks now and let me say that i have owned ALOT of wallet cases for my iPhone 5. Let me list some and why I like this one the most, for now at least. I currently own the Incipio Stashback, the Speck SmartFlex Card, the TwelveSouth BookBook case, the CaseMate Pop ID Case and this one, the Incipio Stowaway. Now I never used any previous models for my iPhone 4 and 4s so I can't really speak on that and speak on if it was different or not. But I can say, out of all the wallet cases i've listed, I like this one ALOT. Between the Speck SmartFlex Card and this one i've been switching back and forth. I like this Stowaway because it is a LITTLE less bulky than the SmartFlex Card case. I like the glossy finish but having a glossy finish also means your case does get scratched up easily and also becomes a finger oil magnet. I swipe this case alot because it gets super oily in the back. Another thing to keep in mind is that the button are VERY hard to press, especially the wake and sleep button. Another thing is that this case does NOT push up on your screen protector if you have any installed on your device. I found that to be an issue with the other case, the Incipio Stashback. This case feels solid and it has a big enough lip to lay your screen down on the table. I have drop my phone a few times off the table or from about a 3 feet distance and the phone and case were intact with no damage whatsoever to the phone nor the case itself. As for the cards, it only fits 3 of my cards. 1 California ID card, 1 Costco membership card and 1 debit card. Unlike the Speck Smartflex which can fit up to 4 cards. But it just depends on the person buying the case. I personally love it, for now at least.

These phones seem to drain the battery quickly when using 3G data, they won't make it through the day.  We were using 3G data a lot as we walked to see the sights in a city each day, enabling GPS to map out which way to walk to the next museum or landmark.  This Duracell backup battery came in very handy because we didn't stop long enough to charge our phones into a wall plug, we were always moving, moving, moving (and we didn't have a rental car, so we couldn't plug a phone into a car charger either).

A16I8SQQIA2B8C,B007ZGGIFI,b. Weiss,"[0, 0]","--UPDATES: well, these lasted less than two months.  First one of the inserts got lost.  It fell off easily, so it was bound to happen.  Second, the connector sleeve fell apart.  It just came off, and disconnected.  I glued it back, and it worked for a while.  But now, it simply has no sound.  This is terrible quality.  It's not worth 1/10 of the price.Unfortunately, I liked its design a lot.  The following is the original review:The angled design is not a gimmick.  It is an essential feature of these earphones to make them stay securely and comfortably in your ears.The acoustic insulation is modest, which to me is a good thing. Some complain that the phones don't go as deep in the ears as they want for better insulation. But one should be aware that plugging earphones very deep in your ears comes with prices: (1) they harm your hearing if you use them too much, which is physically unhealthy; (2) they make you too much ""devoted"" to whatever you're listening, a kind of devotion that requires isolation, which is socially unhealthy; and (3) with your ears blocked, they inherently make telephone conversations very uncomfortable because of an unnatural interference between you own voice and the other caller's voice.  All these detriments for better sound.  I say no to that.  So it is a personal choice.  To my own taste, these earphones already stay a little bit too deep in the ear, so I'm glad that they don't go even deeper and tighter.  But I'm glad that they're secure and comfortableThe microphone works, and so far no one has complained when I make calls.  But these ""in-ear"" phones are a bad choice for making calls, because they all feel very unnatural and uncomfortable when you speak with your ears plugged.  Both you and the other caller would sound strange, and your ears feel uncomfortable (sort of like how you feel if you talk during landing of an airplane). But this problem is not unique to these headphones. They are universal for this type of designs, which are primarily for a listening experience, not for a conversing experience.Cannot comment on its durability.",1.0,Poor quality,1389657600,"01 14, 2014",updates well these lasted less than two months  first one of the inserts got lost  it fell off easily so it was bound to happen  second the connector sleeve fell apart  it just came off and disconnected  i glued it back and it worked for a while  but now it simply has no sound  this is terrible quality  its not worth  of the priceunfortunately i liked its design a lot  the following is the original reviewthe angled design is not a gimmick  it is an essential feature of these earphones to make them stay securely and comfortably in your earsthe acoustic insulation is modest which to me is a good thing some complain that the phones dont go as deep in the ears as they want for better insulation but one should be aware that plugging earphones very deep in your ears comes with prices  they harm your hearing if you use them too much which is physically unhealthy  they make you too much devoted to whatever youre listening a kind of devotion that requires isolation which is socially unhealthy and  with your ears blocked they inherently make telephone conversations very uncomfortable because of an unnatural interference between you own voice and the other callers voice  all these detriments for better sound  i say no to that  so it is a personal choice  to my own taste these earphones already stay a little bit too deep in the ear so im glad that they dont go even deeper and tighter  but im glad that theyre secure and comfortablethe microphone works and so far no one has complained when i make calls  but these inear phones are a bad choice for making calls because they all feel very unnatural and uncomfortable when you speak with your ears plugged  both you and the other caller would sound strange and your ears feel uncomfortable sort of like how you feel if you talk during landing of an airplane but this problem is not unique to these headphones they are universal for this type of designs which are primarily for a listening experience not for a conversing experiencecannot comment on its durability,joy,joy

Well the first 4 days with icon were bluetooth bliss... No more wind noise, no more anything... Way better noise assassin than that of the jawbone 2 or the prime.  I only compare this jawbone to other jawbones... simply because there is no other headset to compare a jawbone to... they are that good.

Well it lost connection to my phone and I started like a mad man raking through 16 inches of snow I had piled up into 3-5 foot tall hills... No luck :(  So I tried again for 3 days and it kept snowing so it was hopeless... My jawbone was in a snowy grave... I then bought another one just because they are that good.  Well today the temp was 62 degrees and all the snow melted.  Low and behold I found my fallen jawbone at the edge of my yard.  This is hopeless right?  WRONG!!!  It charged right up and paired perfectly with my wife's phone.  Now she too has a jawbone icon.. If that isn't the testament to the best bluetooth in the world you tell me what is?

A2BLFCOPSMBOZ9,B0048CEBRY,Dave Edmiston,"[7, 7]","IMPORTANT:  See comments following this review for more info.=====================================I was so bummed when I dropped my 3GS.  It took about two months for the display to become completely unusable.  It was really disappointing.  I had it in a decentIncipiocase, with a silicone inside and hard plastic protecting the back and the corners.  It just wasn't enough protection though--not even for the ~15"" drop.So in picking out a case for my replacement iPhone 4, I went with something even more solid.  I'm very happy with this Otterbox case, despite some of the flaws.Let's start with the flaws, so I can get my whining out of the way:* The hole for the headphone jack hole is in the wrong spot.  That's pretty sorry Quality Assurance, if you ask me.  Someone should have checked that closer. (NOTE:  See ""Edit"" at the end of this review for an update on this issue.)* Lame instructions:  Installing this case is a little complicated--definitely not self-explanatory. There are installation instructions printed on the inside of the back of the box.  They're really hard to see, so I cut open my box to get a better look.  The instructions are line-art diagrams and aren't that easy to interpret.  I visited the URL printed beneath the instructions, but got a 404 error (yes, I typed it correctly).  I finally found the instructions page on their website, which is a link to a Youtube video.  I guess that's OK, because even if I weren't at my PC I could still get to Youtube on my iPhone.  Still, it seemed like a lot of steps to get to the help I needed.* The case & holster add a lot of bulk to the phone, but I'm willing to live with the bulk to keep my phone safe.OK.  I'm done whining now.I actually really like this case.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for the reasons noted above.  The pluses far outweigh the minuses though.  This case (especially this color combo) is very nice looking.  I picked the white & black combo for the Storm Trooper look (nerd alert!).  It really looks nice.  And aside from the misplaced headphone jack hole, the fit & finish are astounding.  The device snaps snugly into the two hard plastic clamshell pieces. The plastic pieces include contours, tabs, and slots for the silicone case to fit into.  The result is very nice.Inside the plastic case there is also a clear plastic cover that fits over the screen.  It fits perfectly and doesn't impede the use of the touch screen much at all.  I had to get used to the extra pressure needed to get through the clear plastic cover, but that didn't take long.Also included is a hard plastic holster.  I'm not sure I'm in love with the holster, but time will tell.  It adds more to the bulk of the device, but it's also very handy.  The clip for the holster also snaps open and rotates so you can use it as a stand.  That's nice if you use your phone as an alarm clock or if you want to watch videos on a flight.Bottom Line:  If you're paranoid about protecting your iPhone device and you don't mind the extra bulk, this is a great case for you.  Browse the different color choices to find one that fits your style.EDIT (1/12/11):  I contacted Otterbox support to ask them if they were aware of the mis-aligned hole for the headphone jack.  They responded to me and told me that this is by design.  The hole isn't supposed to be for a headphone plug; the hole is there for the iPhone 4's noise dampening microphone.  They said that the headphone jack is intentionally covered and that I should open the little flap to plug in my headphones.  Fair enough.  Seems like a weird design to me, but I get it now.",3.0,Big tough case,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",important  see comments following this review for more infoi was so bummed when i dropped my gs  it took about two months for the display to become completely unusable  it was really disappointing  i had it in a decentincipiocase with a silicone inside and hard plastic protecting the back and the corners  it just wasnt enough protection thoughnot even for the  dropso in picking out a case for my replacement iphone  i went with something even more solid  im very happy with this otterbox case despite some of the flawslets start with the flaws so i can get my whining out of the way the hole for the headphone jack hole is in the wrong spot  thats pretty sorry quality assurance if you ask me  someone should have checked that closer note  see edit at the end of this review for an update on this issue lame instructions  installing this case is a little complicateddefinitely not selfexplanatory there are installation instructions printed on the inside of the back of the box  theyre really hard to see so i cut open my box to get a better look  the instructions are lineart diagrams and arent that easy to interpret  i visited the url printed beneath the instructions but got a  error yes i typed it correctly  i finally found the instructions page on their website which is a link to a youtube video  i guess thats ok because even if i werent at my pc i could still get to youtube on my iphone  still it seemed like a lot of steps to get to the help i needed the case  holster add a lot of bulk to the phone but im willing to live with the bulk to keep my phone safeok  im done whining nowi actually really like this case  i gave it  stars instead of  for the reasons noted above  the pluses far outweigh the minuses though  this case especially this color combo is very nice looking  i picked the white  black combo for the storm trooper look nerd alert  it really looks nice  and aside from the misplaced headphone jack hole the fit  finish are astounding  the device snaps snugly into the two hard plastic clamshell pieces the plastic pieces include contours tabs and slots for the silicone case to fit into  the result is very niceinside the plastic case there is also a clear plastic cover that fits over the screen  it fits perfectly and doesnt impede the use of the touch screen much at all  i had to get used to the extra pressure needed to get through the clear plastic cover but that didnt take longalso included is a hard plastic holster  im not sure im in love with the holster but time will tell  it adds more to the bulk of the device but its also very handy  the clip for the holster also snaps open and rotates so you can use it as a stand  thats nice if you use your phone as an alarm clock or if you want to watch videos on a flightbottom line  if youre paranoid about protecting your iphone device and you dont mind the extra bulk this is a great case for you  browse the different color choices to find one that fits your styleedit   i contacted otterbox support to ask them if they were aware of the misaligned hole for the headphone jack  they responded to me and told me that this is by design  the hole isnt supposed to be for a headphone plug the hole is there for the iphone s noise dampening microphone  they said that the headphone jack is intentionally covered and that i should open the little flap to plug in my headphones  fair enough  seems like a weird design to me but i get it now,joy,joy

Battery holds charge and seems to be close to the capacity they advertise.Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the built in micro-USB cable it too think to fit past most phone/device cases. That kinda puts a dent on the portability factor.Also, it has no real on/off button. It detects when you plug in the device. But seems to have an issue if the device gets disconnected at the other end of the cable. For example, I used the normal USB port and a magnetic charging cable with my phone. When the magnetic end accidentally disconnects and I reattach it, it doesn't start charging. I had to unplug the cable on the battery pack end and replug it in for it to start charging. Sometimes I even have to unplug and replug the build it cable for the other USB port to start charging.Lastly, the built in USB cable lock in pretty tightly (as in stretch the cable) into the micro USB charging slot. So I'm worried that in the long run it might break more easily due to the stress on the cable. But this part is just a hypothesis, not that I have had it long enough to break.I consider Anker to be a better brand than EasyAcc since the 12000mAh EasyAcc battery pack that I got sometime back hardly charges my Nexus 4 2 times.

AGVWTYW0ULXHT,B007MC6WGK,"Nathan Andersen ""Gadget lover and author of S...","[0, 0]","I love the design on these - that they link together behind the head, and you can easily control volume and phone answering with a little set of buttons that hang near your neck.  There are three bud sizes, and they fit nicely in my ears and stay there even when I'm running. I know others have complained about the fit, but for me they've been fine.The sound is a bit more muddy than other earphones I've tried, even much less expensive plug-in earphones.  As others have noted, the bass quality is also very weak.  So I'd say these are not the best choice for the audiophile, and not the best choice if your primary purpose is to listen to music cord free.  On the other hand, they do sound well enough, and so if your main aim is hands-free calling, and you only listen to music every once in a while, these wouldn't be a bad way to go.  They work fine for calls, but perhaps the mike input is a bit low for receivers on the other end.I have noticed that they seem to stutter and drop Bluetooth signal a bit more frequently than other Bluetooth-enabled devices I've tried.  That has happened both with my phone and with my computer (note that unlike many other Bluetooth devices I've tried these can only be ""paired"" to one device at a time - so they wouldn't be useful if you wanted to pair them to your phone on a commute and then to your computer once you got to work).Overall, these are not bad, but I've tried better (likethisone that doesn't look as good as these but sounds and performs better at a lower cost; orthisone that sounds and performs quite a bit better but at a higher cost).

Using my company cell phone (a Galaxy S3) and this speaker, we are able to listen to music throughout the whole office and into the back warehouse as well. The GDock comes with 5 different cradle adapters, for the Galaxy S1, S2, S3 and the Note 1 and 2. I use the adapter for the S3 with the GDock, which came with it already pre-installed. The S3 slides right into it, and plugs in at the base. Each of the docks can also be rotated sideways, which in turn sets your device screen on landscape view.The speaker has power buttons and volume buttons on both the GDock itself (at the top) and also on the wireless remote control that comes with it. The remote is small, not much larger than the palm of my hand. It would easily fit into a pants pocket. You can also adjust the treble and bass or mute the speaker, all from the remote. A battery is included, so you won't need to buy one for the remote control prior to using it.The included auxiliary cable plugs into the back of the speaker, allowing you to use all kinds of other (non-Galaxy) devices. We've used the auxiliary cable with several other players so people could listen to their play-lists. We've used MP3 players, iPods, Kindle Fires, etc. All have worked great!The speaker is weighty and feels solid. Not cheap and flimsy at all. It comes with a wall power adapter, and there is also an optional rechargeable battery made for this speaker (sold separately). When your device is plugged into the speakers dock, it will play your music and also charge your Galaxy at the same time, assuming you're using the wall adapter to power it. After reading through the included information, I did see that if you're using the optional rechargeable battery with this GDock and it's not plugged in to the wall adapter as well, it will just play music and not charge your device at the same time. This way, the power in the rechargeable battery is saved for running the speaker for as long as possible.This GDock has been great to have in the office, and everyone loves it. It works well, sounds great and will play music as loudly or as softly as we want it. Even right now I'm downloading a playlist of Christmas music to my phone, so we can have it playing in the office for the holidays on the GDock. I was provided a sample unit from the manufacturer for an unbiased review of its performance. Grace Digital makes a wide variety of nice speaker docks, including one for the Kindle Fire called theMatchStick.

It worked fine, but once removed one of the little 'tabs' broke on the top piece. I found this Holster case and decided to try it out - it's awesome! It's like the pricey plastic fitted hard case but better! It fits the same way, but it's easier to 'grip' and I'm less likely to drop it when carrying other things. The case is much 'sturdier' compared to the plastic case and the case fits snugly but goes on easily (much easier than the plastic case had). The keyboard slides out perfectly and feels 'tight' and more controlled than it did without it. It fits in the holster nicely and is easy to remove when I need it. The holster clips on me easily and is also easy to remove. The little case stand works great too!Overall, this is the best case I've had for any phone (and I've had many!). HIGHLY recommend it!Editing to add on July 2nd, 2012: I still LOVE THIS CASE. I've had to remove it a few times now, it's simple to remove and put back on and doesn't break! The case is super strong so dropping it truly protects it. And the little 'stand' is amazing!

It fits right on there, but it would not fit on a large one. It works well on my medium or small one. If I did use a large one, I'd likely just use a small clip or one of those keychain rings to attach it.It is very tight to get it on and off, but I don't see that as a bad thing. It keeps it from coming apart when not in use. And in the dark disorganized cavern that is my purse, that's a good thing.The cord itself is very short. At first I was disappointed in this and wished that it was retractable. But I quickly realized that that would just come undone in my purse as things got moved around in there. I use this mainly for charging from my power bricks to my phone or tablet device. That works well because it's just long enough to reach so I can stack my phone on top of the power brick and still be able to use it.If you're looking for something to charge from your computer or wall plug, this isn't for you, but for quick on-the-go charging or if you're one to forget your charging cord, then this is perfect.I love it so much and my kids are asking for one for each of them as well for their backpacks/purses so they can charge their gear using their own power supplies in a pinch.

A3E1IXJ949VL29,B00526TW60,JCR,"[2, 2]","As others have said there are limited choices for the Thunderbolt with the extended battery.  Since HTC only includes a wimpy little battery that only lasts a few hours I don't see how you can't buy an extended battery to get through the day.  Initially I thought I could get away without it as things would balance out and battery life would improve and was using the regular battery with the Body Glove case which was perfect.  Alas, the included battery never got any better so I bought the extended one and unfortunately the Body Glove case wouldn't fit the phone with the extended battery and I can't find a Body Glove case to replace it so began the hunt for a new case.  This Seidio seemed to be the best option which arrived today and I already can't stand it especially compared to the Body Glove case. To point out the positives, it does install easily, fits the phone well, and seems like it will add a nice level of protection for the phone.  I also like the side grips quite a bit.  The Seidio does not feel the least bit slippery to me which is of course a good thing.  What I really dislike about the Seidio is that you can't use the sturdy included kickstand and the kickstand with the Seidio case is just an incredibly flimsy piece of plastic that feels like it may break at any time.  The kickstand is also an extremely tight fit into the case  nearly needing a pry bar to open it and its equally difficult to close.  Every time I close it the kickstand feels like its about to break off and it very well may very soon but I shouldn't have to worry about that each time I use it.  The kickstand also makes a very loud clicking sound when you close it.  That's not good when you need to be stealthy in a meeting, at the movies, etc. It also has a chemical smell to the case which transfers to your hands. I hope this smell fades over time and that its not toxic but for now I'm washing my hands more than ever thanks to this case. I suppose for now this is really the only choice unfortunately if you use the extended battery but I really look forward to the day when I can ditch it for a Body Glove case.

A2ZGFXH842GOJF,B00AOCSFYC,MT,"[0, 0]","Finally, the dock that I've been searching for!  A somewhat universal dock with a singe cable hook up!  What's not to like?  Well, as far as docks go, it does the job.  It holds the device well, will adjust to a variety of phones with all but the bulkiest of cases, and I have yet to have the suction cup fail (mounted to the disk stuck to my dash). I have mounted it to the window and it's solid there as well. The adjustable sliders at the bottom are nice, but one of them has already stripped out and does not lock in place so it slide in every time I dock my phone.  Not a big issue but can be a pain sometimes.  I wish they would have made them adjustable with a screw instead of the plastic locks.What really excited me about this mount was the combo usb/audio cable.  Seemed like a simple and elegant solution.  Although the dock was not originally shipped with the audio cable, iBolt was nice enough to send a basic charging dock cable until the audio cables came back in stock.  The month or so wait was sort of a pain, having to connect 2 cables since I had to use the headphone jack for audio through my car aux port.When the 9ft audio cable finally arrived I was excited to put it to use.  Attached the new cable and charging arm to the dock, changed the settings on my phone and had audio via a single connection!  What's not to love?  Well, the audio quality, that's what...it was horrible.  Barely sounded better than AM radio. No bass at all! I checked all my connections (probably a dozen times by now) and still no improvement.I sent an e-mail to iBolt, and a few days later they were kind enough to send me instructions on how to connect the new cable and ensure that I use the new charging arm that came with the cable.  Thanks, but I already made sure of that.  Still horrible sound.  I've sent an additional email asking if this is a known problem and have not received a response in almost 3 weeks now.  I am still hoping to hear back, but I have my doubts...seemed like a good company from all the reviews I've seen, so maybe they will respond and solve the issue soon.So, to date I am still using the 2 wire set up. If the cable were working fine I would have no problem recommending this dock. But for the price, and without a proper functioning cable, I cannot recommend this dock...there are just too many decent universal docks (iOttie, Samsung, Exomount) that do the same thing for less.  The cable was the selling point for me, and so far that is a fail.Update: 5/31/13 I sent them a new email using there online contact form and selected ""warranty or service claim"" and they promptly responded by sending out a new cable.  It should be here in a couple days.  Hopefully this one will sound better.  If so, I will be changing this to 5 stars!Update: 7/9/13 New cable received (no new charging arm) and the sound is no better.  So I have been connecting the phone through the headphone jack, but plan to get a bluetooth adapter.  So my review is staying at 3 stars.  It's a good mount, but since the cable is useless to me (my main reason for buying it) I feel I over payed.If you have any questions feel free to ask!

But it isn't diamond proof. So I ordered this skin for my wife's phone, and mine for when she comes near it.I have used Skinomi in the past, with great results, but the rounded back of the S3 led that company cut a ""T"" in each corner of the back cover film that, by the picture, looked like it would catch in my pocket. In contrast, the Armorsuit cover uses a slit with a circle at each corner to deal with the curvature. This decision was purely speculative, but I thought less slits in the film would translate into less snag, so I went with this one. It was also a few bucks cheaper. I can't appreciate any significant differences from the Skinomi skins that I have used for my previous Evo 4G, Iphone 4S, and Kindle Fire.As usual, it is a wet application, so you need to make sure your device is clean (I use a little windex first), and apply with precision. Drawbacks are the same as Skinomi, as the device will be more ""sticky"" so if you have a glass top desk or table you work from, it won't slide to you as easily with the film on (this might be an advantage to some).  It also will stick to the plastic faces on workout arm bands, so you need to pry it out once it's in there. Not a big issue, unless your life requires you to take your phone out during a workout for some reason.I don't find any issues in touch sensitivity with or without the screen.

A25TNBMJ4ZO7RD,B000NKCO5Q,M. Potvin,"[1, 1]","I'll first start out by saying that I absolutely love these headphones. I never really thought that I'd be so happy going with a cordless headphone, but the convenience factor is amazing. When I'm in our small office, I can leave my BlackBerry sitting on my desk, and walk anywhere in the office, fill up my coffee, go to the fridge, and never drop out. Sound quality is relatively good, about what you'd expect from a headphone that is oriented towards an active lifestyle that is making some compromise on design for sound quality.The buds that will come installed are garbage. Don't even bother with them, they hurt my ears after wearing for a short period of time. Make sure you put the rubber ones that are symmetrical on. My buddy bought a ""white box"" kit from another vendor who was selling for much cheaper, and they didn't come with any of the accessories, so be careful where you buy!In regards to dropping out. Strangely, with my phone on my hip, the signal does sometimes drop out. Very intermittent, talking like a fraction of a second, but of course noticeable when you're playing music.The protrusion of the headphones from the back of the head is very pronounced. They are a snug fit going around your head, some people complain that they don't think that they will be able to get them on. I have a big head (self proclaimed) and I have no issues with that. I can't sit back on the sofa with them on because of the protrusion. Likewise, this means you can't bench press wearing these headphones.The headphones also double as a hands free headset. The mic is back near the earpiece. I didn't think that it would pick up speech very well, but it does quite a good job as a handsfree device as well. I don't recommend driving with it of course, I use it at the office. The BlackBerry rings in the earpiece when listening to music to alert you to a call. Another caveat is that there is no notification in the headset when you receive an email.I've had great success pairing these with the Jabra A120S. I actually hooked up the Jabra to the audio out on my LCD TV so I can listen to the TV (ie. play on the Wii) without disturbing others. My wife uses it for the same purpose while on the treadmill so she doesn't need to blast the volume. I used the A120 on a Creative Vision with these headphones as well. No complaints. Now that I have an iPod (wake up Apple - give us BT) I'll use the A120 for pairing when I need this style headphone.Overall the cordless convenience is very nice. They could use some refinement, but they are a nice addition to your headphone collection.

It requires a bit of force but if your intent is to not have the thing come out, there is no way it can EVER fall out because it is so secure it becomes part of the ibolt doc once you get the top lever on the phone.

A3KNC6TMSG33J3,B00GH0JXAK,S. Kuang,"[3, 4]","Let me first start off by saying that this battery pack has met and exceeded all my expectations for it.  While the rest of the external battery packs by NewTrent are 60-70 dollars, this one comes in at around 40.  The differences?  Those are a little more rugged and built to perform in extreme conditions.This battery pack has a nice matte black finish with a gray band around the sides.  There are two USB output ports on it.  One of them is 2.1 amps, labeled for tablets, and the other is 1 amp, designed for smartphones.  It has almost the same dimensions as an iPhone 5/s/c.  The length and width are almost the same but the depth of the battery pack is a little less than 3 iPhones stacked on top of each other.There is an LED strip near the top, by the USB ports.  It contains 4 LEDs that let you know when the battery pack is charging, and when it is in use.  And the LEDs tell you how much power is still left in this bad boy.I did some tests on this battery pack.  It took a little more than 5 hours to charge it from dead to full.  And it took 1 hour and 40 minutes to charge my iPhone from 5% to 100%.  After It charged up my phone it still had all four LEDs.Theoretically  this battery pack should be able to charge my iPhone 7.6 times because it has 11000 mAh and my phone has a 1440 mAh battery.This is going to be a life saver for me since I use my phone so much and I don't carry around my charger.  Since the battery pack is so thick, I don't think you are going to want to stuff this in your pants pocket, but it will fit very comfortably in a backpack or throw in the car.This has done everything that it's advertised to do and it does it very well.

I've owned the iPhone for over a year now, and ever since I've had it I've had to deal with dropped calls, something I never had an issue with when I had Verizon.  While that situation is an entirely different review, I can say that after using this signal booster in a remote area it works extremely well!  I have used this in a few areas outside of town where I know the signal strength is low, and this booster increased from two bars to five bars.  Pretty impressive.  When I made a few calls the quality was strong, and there was no echo or delay which is something that happens with some regularity when I don't use this booster.  Additionally, my text messages sent quickly and painlessly from these remote areas as well.  When I try to text from these outlying areas without the booster the text messages will stall for a minute or two before they send, or in some cases not send at all.My first impression upon using this was annoyance in knowing that cell phone companies are unwilling to go out and build more towers so people wouldn't have to buy things like a signal booster.  Why shouldn't a phone just, well, work?  Obviously, the answer to that is ""not really"", making this signal booster a strong purchase for those who travel a lot and find themselves in varying levels of cell phone activity.

AOAOARIH72UWI,B00486MH80,jt,"[0, 0]","This is a pretty nice device to have in one's bag or purse for those times you need an emergency charge.  I've tried it on an iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, Moto BT earpiece, and a couple of older generation iPod Nanos and it has done a good job on all the devices.  I fully charged it and have had it in my bag for a couple of weeks without touching it and when I turn it on it looks like it has held pretty much all of its charge.It can accommodate a standard USB plug and has a micro USB plug built in to it.  Note, there is NOT a MINI USB connection built in.  To charge something that uses a mini USB you have to have an additional wire that goes from standard USB to mini USB.  I personally don't have anything that can be charged via micro USB and several things that can be charged via mini USB so I would have liked to see an integrated mini USB line included.  I'm guessing all newer Moto stuff uses micro USB.  Minus a quarter of a star for not showing the mini USB any love...It is a very nice size being just smaller and just as thick as an iPhone 4.  Very light weight.  To charge the unit itself a dedicated micro USB port is provided.  It can charge via the included wall plug to micro USB or standard USB (from your computer) to micro USB.  If you feel like you might need to charge it while out you need to carry an additional plug or cable.  I think it would have been nice if they could have integrated a flip out standard USB plug for charging.  Or made a mini USB port available for charging so that you could use the same standard USB to mini USB cable you would likely carry around anyway.  In either case you could eliminate the need to carry a cord around just for charging.  Again, minus a quarter of a star...

A1323GVRLTJ6LC,B00HWEMZ1E,Nick,"[2, 2]","I got this phone around launch time. At that time I couldn't decide on the HTC ONE m7 or this phone. I chose this phone because I have had windows phone before (928) and liked it. The audio quality when listening through wired headphones with dolby on and an equalizer on sounds beautiful, I always go to my phone to listen to music.There are a lot of people and I mean a lot who look at windows phone and leave it almost instantly because of their app store. The app store has got more popular apps since early 2013. Tunein use to be junk but they fixed it so it works almost flawlessly, they have a good selection. But if you use your phone for a boat load of apps expecting the size of android or ios than the phone may not work with you unless you keep your old device to use the apps you did before. And the best part is that you can go to windowsphone.com to see what apps are there and what is not there.This phone is speedy, I have not had this phone freeze up or lag on me at all. I can sit there and play music and game at the same time on this phone. I know, you are thinking &#34;well pretty much any phone can do that&#34;. Well here is my favorite part. Press a volume key like you are going to change the volume and you get a quick drop down of basic music controls to change track or pause while you are playing a game without leaving the game.The call quality on this phone is awesome. So is the antenna. When I am in a metal building I have 1-2 bars of 3g or 1x which is better than no bars. Text messages go through quick and when you are low on signal you may receive duplicate messages from a person, the phone does this just to make sure you got the message.Finding a screen protector may be a pain since the glass on this phone curves on the edges. Your best bet would be a wet install like skinomi or armor suit. For me, I use a tpu case with an armorsuit screen protector and it is a great combination. Though I really wish it was possible for someone to make a glass screen protector but that will probably never happen.Pictures and video are great on this phone. I use this phone to take pictures more than a seperate camera that I have because it is more convenient and still has great quality.Overall I recommend this phone to anyone.",5.0,Really good smartphone,1402790400,"06 15, 2014",i got this phone around launch time at that time i couldnt decide on the htc one m or this phone i chose this phone because i have had windows phone before  and liked it the audio quality when listening through wired headphones with dolby on and an equalizer on sounds beautiful i always go to my phone to listen to musicthere are a lot of people and i mean a lot who look at windows phone and leave it almost instantly because of their app store the app store has got more popular apps since early  tunein use to be junk but they fixed it so it works almost flawlessly they have a good selection but if you use your phone for a boat load of apps expecting the size of android or ios than the phone may not work with you unless you keep your old device to use the apps you did before and the best part is that you can go to windowsphonecom to see what apps are there and what is not therethis phone is speedy i have not had this phone freeze up or lag on me at all i can sit there and play music and game at the same time on this phone i know you are thinking well pretty much any phone can do that well here is my favorite part press a volume key like you are going to change the volume and you get a quick drop down of basic music controls to change track or pause while you are playing a game without leaving the gamethe call quality on this phone is awesome so is the antenna when i am in a metal building i have  bars of g or x which is better than no bars text messages go through quick and when you are low on signal you may receive duplicate messages from a person the phone does this just to make sure you got the messagefinding a screen protector may be a pain since the glass on this phone curves on the edges your best bet would be a wet install like skinomi or armor suit for me i use a tpu case with an armorsuit screen protector and it is a great combination though i really wish it was possible for someone to make a glass screen protector but that will probably never happenpictures and video are great on this phone i use this phone to take pictures more than a seperate camera that i have because it is more convenient and still has great qualityoverall i recommend this phone to anyone,joy,joy

It paired very easily with Windows Mobile and Android Phones (Samsung, Motorola, HTC); as well as my B/T equipped laptop (HP).Wearibility-wise, although it caused the some annoying discomfort in back of my right ear, it rested well over the ears. Perhaps a softer (rubberized?) padding around the plastic band would have helped.The audio/call control buttons are placed intuitively. I found the B/T range to be excellent. A very nice feature is that with my phone set to mute, I could receive the various audible notifications (email, text message, incoming phone call) on the headset.The sound quality is very good although not as good as in high-frequency range an ""in-ear"" set might provide but this IMHO is a trade-off (as most in-ear sets don't have very good low-frequency reproduction). The volume range is excellent which compensated very well for the muted highs.I have worn this headset while working-out and had no issues.

A1W415JP5WEAJK,B00ELVA6F8,Alex S,"[1, 1]","I have an iPad 2 which has a smaller battery than the later versions (about 6800). As a result, this particular battery will fully charge my iPad 2 and significantly charge my iPhone both without running out of power. However, if you have a more contemporary iPad, this will significantly charge your later iPad but will not fully do so.I am not certain of the stats on this model of battery, but there is ALWAYS a loss of power between the battery and the device, so I usually don't count on an effective charge greater than 85%, which would make this 8500 mAh.I was surprised when this arrived to discover that it was fully charged with no loss of power between the company and arrival at home so I was able to immediately test it. It rather quickly was able to charge up a 2800 mAh battery that was between 50 and 70% full using 15% of the power, which leads me to believe that it has an effective transfer ratio, something important in the battery.It also has a relatively powerful (for this type of battery) flashlight using brighter LED bulbs.Power Bank Evaluation:mAh - 10,000#and Amps of Charging ports - Two ports, one is 1.0 Amp and the other is 2.1 Amp fully capable of charging an iPad.Physical size - Medium sized, slightly larger than a deck of cards. Probably a bit too heavy to carry in a pocket comfortably.How is the charger charged - it uses a standard micro cable (included) to charge and can be used on your own USB charger or can be charged on your laptop.What cords/attachments are included - It comes with a micro cable to charge itself (can also be used to charge anything that takes a micro cable), and a cord with an end that supports various attachments. The three that are included are the 30 pin USB for older Apple products, a micro cord, and a Nokia connector.What other features/items are included - It has a relatively powerful flashlight making this a great emergency bedside battery. You can keep your devices charged as well as finding your way in case of a power outage.Instructions (included/clear) - Yes, instructions are included and are clear (if a bit small for my older eyes).Support Information - I could not locate support information in the packaging.

This is the closest I've come so far.Here's the good:===========================* By far, the best thing about it is the noise-cancelling feature. I'm on the road a lot, and the ""max"" setting almost eliminates road and background noise on the other end...my daughter said she hated talking to me when I was on the road before I bought this headset. This is a MAJOR plus, and the main reason I bought it to begin with. It simply works!* Volume is LOUD! In those noisy environments, this is a plus, and I usually have to turn it down to mid-range, even in noisy areas.* Unlike some, it is very comfortable to me, for long periods of time, and I wear mine for hours at a time. Lighweight and small...compared to my Motorola H700, it's heaven. I forget it's even on sometimes.* I love the quick disconnect, reconnect feature using the volume up/down buttons.  I use it with two phones (Motorola V325 for work and Blackberry 8700c for personal), and this makes it a breeze to switch from one to the other without having to fumble through the phone menus. (If you use it with a Blackberry, be sure to turn off the ""Echo Control"" setting in the BT menu for this headset.)* Clip for your shirt or pocket.* The price is very reasonable for a headset with these advanced features.So, what kept it from being 5-stars?=====================================* Proprietary charger (why not mini-USB, except to make more money?)* Slippery plastic ear hook, though they do include extras.* Talk time is okay, but not great. I can get maybe 4-5 hours out of it, putting it squarely in the average range based on my experiences.But these are minor, nitpicking complaints.

You can turn it on by pressing and holding the power button for about 1.5 seconds; it turns off the same way.The iFlash 3200 can be a great gift.

A34OYJG21BGCZO,B002VDSZII,Jenni Willingham,"[10, 10]","This product was horrible.  It did not come with the guide as promised, forcing me to navigate through the many you tube videos for one that would work (if you do decide to buy this part make sure the video you are using is specifically for the 3GS as there are a few differences in where you will pry).  The screwdriver fit the external screws on the phone, but was too large for the six internal screws used to hold the LCD to the glass.  The screwdriver size needed is a Phillips 1.6mm screwdriver (which will work for all screws on the phone), I was given a size 2.0mm (you can find the correct screwdriver at radio shack if you still decide to buy this part).  Also, the pre-cut adhesive provided was not properly trimmed and was bigger than the area into which it was supposed to fit.  The worst thing about this set is that the case opener tools provided are too wide to fit into the cracks they are supposed to, making prying the screen assembly out a daunting task (I ended up using a very small, non-magnetic flat-head screwdriver, which worked very well). The case opener tools are also made of such malleable plastic that pieces of them broke off in the phone and my LCD was badly damaged, causing my entire phone to be useless. (whatever you do, do not use the prying method of removing the LCD from the glass, there is an alternate method involving wedging a kitchen knife between two pieces of metal (videos can be found on you tube) that is much more safe for your LCD, particularly since the tools provided with this kit are likely to break and cause further damage to your phone.  This repair is not difficult if you have the right tools and your screen is not too badly cracked at the top and bottom frame.  If is is badly cracked in those places, you have to heat the frame several times over and peel each individual shard of glass from the adhesive before you can begin to apply the new glass.  I would recommend a full assembly product that includes new LCD screen, glass digitizer assemble already connected to the frame, home button, and earpiece.  This will cost you about $60, but will only take you about 3 minutes to complete (even if you are not tech savvy) and will only require you to remove and replace two screws and three small cables, instead of a process which involves removing 6 screws, 3 cables, carefully prying your LCD off without damaging it, melting adhesive in order to do some more prying and getting glass shard all over the house, removing difficult excess adhesive, reapplying new adhesive without allowing air bubbles, replacing the glass properly, then reversing the whole process.

I looked at this item in a couple of stores, but there was no way I would spend almost $50 on a case for my phone.  I've only just gotten my otterbox case, but it's everything I wanted and more.  I love the built in screen protector - its built in to the inner hard plastic shell, as opposed to the ones that smooth out on your screen.  The holster is fantastic and really gives the phone the protection it needs.  It does make the phone a bit bulkier but it looks really cool though, Otterbox did a great job with the design.  Personally I like the extra bulk of this case - for me, my particular blackberry (8530) is a bit skinny and lacks the weight and substance that I like in a phone.  I like the look of my phone much better in this case.  I have had to remove my battery before I got the case, I'm not bothered about removing 3 layers, but I do hope the rubber doesn't loose its fit when I do.  I would definitely recommend this case.

If you don't have Powermat product, and don't plan on purchasing one, then this product is not for you - why pay for something you'll never use?.  If you are a member of the Powermat family, then it's a great idea. Powermat adapters are available for almost any device - not just Apple devices - heck, even some cars now have Powermat chargers on the dash.The battery is not all that powerful - it will charge most phones 3-4 times, and the average tablet once. I rarely use battery packs to just charge devices - I'll have them attached on long commutes so the device runs off the external battery. Then when the external dies, I switch to the device - then I know EXACTLY how much time I have left.  This battery pack has a USB port so you can plug in your device's charge cable for non-powermat devices.So, if you're a Powermat user - this is a big thumbs up.  Not a Powermat user? Skip it. Four stars because of the mediocre battery capacity. I can't find an exact capacity given anywhere. The unit has ""15.54 Wh"" on the back. This means you have to do some math. Divide 15.54 (watt-hours) by the battery voltage (volts) for Ah (Amp-hours). USB is 5 volts, so I'll go with that - bit it's a guess. Multiply by 1000 to get mAh.

I was a die-hard Android fan-boy but now that I have a Windows Phone, everything seems so much simpler to use. I spend more productive time with my phone and less time &#34;tweaking&#34; the OS. I get a ton of compliments on the phone (I also purchased the Speck Cand Shell Grip Case and use an IQ Shield LIQuidSkin as my screen protector.) This phone is sharp!Here were my top three purchasing factors:Battery Life: This has been the best battery life I have ever experienced with a smart phone. I haven't had to do any special tricks like I did in Android to make it a complete day. With my Lumia 1020, I am usually around 40% before I plug it in the evenings.Screen Quality: I just started wearing glasses, so this was a deciding factor. Text is *razor* sharp and the Windows Phone OS has the ability to set saturation for color and color temperature. I am not a big fan of &#34;melt your eyeballs&#34; color pop, but I will have to say that this display has to be one of the most color-accurate displays I've experienced. Details are sharp, but colors are not overdriven. I've been able to spend hours reading on my phone without having to take a break or feeling like my eyes were been drilled out. I read a lot more on my phone because of this.Camera: The sharpness and resolution capabilities on this phone are amazing. There are different &#34;lenses&#34; (read apps) for different shooting styles, capture modes and special effects. Being able to set your depth of field really makes your photos stand out. I have yet to take a bad picture.

A3TWBW1B17R151,B003N3J6BU,"liat2768 ""liat2768""","[20, 21]","I forget my cellphone at home all the time and, when I do remember to take it with me, often have to answer it while driving. Neither is a particularly good thing and if you have the same issue then the ZOMM sounds like a godsend.It syncs with your phone via the bluetooth connection (which means you cannot use another blutooth device) and functions as a speakerphone while driving, alerts you if it is more than a certain distance from your cellphone, allows you to call 911 at the press of a button and emits an panic alarm if you need it to.I was able to sync the ZOMM to my phone with no problem at all. Changing the settings of my device (turning off the panic alarm which seemed just to easy to trigger in a crowded bag) was a little harder since I could not access the correct place on the website for a while.Biggest cons:This is no more than a bluetooth on a keychain. The speaker phone aspect when actually driving (which means the Zomm is swinging from your ignition) is not so good. Scratchy at best, indecipherable at worst.This thing needs to be charged regularly. Even more regularly than my phone. So, there have been plenty of times that I have waltzed out of the door sans phone since my ZOMM has run flat and so failed to function as a 'leash'. If it has a warning beep for when it needs charging, I have not heard it. Perhaps the next model needs a battery that holds a longer charge time??The price is way more than acceptable, in my mind, for something that promises much and delivers little.Pros:As a personal safety device, I suppose it replaces an Onstar system in case of an accident. Press a button and you can call 911 - as long as you have remembered to charge it, of course.It is tiny and light and clips on to your keychain without turning it into a monster mess.So, in my mind the pros do not stack up so well against the cons. My husband has a Jabra cruiser speakerphone in his car and it is a dream. You can get it on Amazon for just over $60. You can use it to call 911 and I would highly recommend the jabra cruiser2 as oppossed to the ZOMM.As to the wireless leash reminding me to take my phone - I think I'll revert to the stone age and put a sticky note reminder on my steering wheel. :)",2.0,"Promises so much, delivers so little.",1313452800,"08 16, 2011",i forget my cellphone at home all the time and when i do remember to take it with me often have to answer it while driving neither is a particularly good thing and if you have the same issue then the zomm sounds like a godsendit syncs with your phone via the bluetooth connection which means you cannot use another blutooth device and functions as a speakerphone while driving alerts you if it is more than a certain distance from your cellphone allows you to call  at the press of a button and emits an panic alarm if you need it toi was able to sync the zomm to my phone with no problem at all changing the settings of my device turning off the panic alarm which seemed just to easy to trigger in a crowded bag was a little harder since i could not access the correct place on the website for a whilebiggest consthis is no more than a bluetooth on a keychain the speaker phone aspect when actually driving which means the zomm is swinging from your ignition is not so good scratchy at best indecipherable at worstthis thing needs to be charged regularly even more regularly than my phone so there have been plenty of times that i have waltzed out of the door sans phone since my zomm has run flat and so failed to function as a leash if it has a warning beep for when it needs charging i have not heard it perhaps the next model needs a battery that holds a longer charge timethe price is way more than acceptable in my mind for something that promises much and delivers littleprosas a personal safety device i suppose it replaces an onstar system in case of an accident press a button and you can call   as long as you have remembered to charge it of courseit is tiny and light and clips on to your keychain without turning it into a monster messso in my mind the pros do not stack up so well against the cons my husband has a jabra cruiser speakerphone in his car and it is a dream you can get it on amazon for just over  you can use it to call  and i would highly recommend the jabra cruiser as oppossed to the zommas to the wireless leash reminding me to take my phone  i think ill revert to the stone age and put a sticky note reminder on my steering wheel ,joy,joy

A1O229NVVDJUX2,B002L6GFBE,"Anthony Pantliano ""The Photo Guy""","[1, 2]","The TENQA SP-109 Bluetooth stereo speaker system work well, but could use a tweak in its sound quality.The TENQA is like an 8/10th scale version of the Bose SoundDock.  It sports the same arc shaped speaker front, but lacks a dock of any sort since you'd most likely be getting your music into the TENQA using its excellent Bluetooth connectivity.  The player is very light in weight and has nice rubber feet on the bottom to keep it from sliding around.  All of the speaker's controls are on the right hand side of the unit and include a power switch, a volume wheel, an auxiliary input (via the included 3.5mm mini jack cable), and the power cord jack.  While it feels nicely screwed together, and the plastics are of a decent quality, the curve of the metal speaker cover can show some slight ripples when viewed at certain angles.  They are not bad at all, but do show a lack of commitment to final detail quality.  The only other two things of note are that the system cannot run on batteries and does not include a remote, both of which would have been nice additions.The Bluetooth connectivity of the TENQA is definitely this speaker system's high point and works well with all the devices I tried it with.  I streamed music from an Apple iPhone 3Gs, Nokia N96, Apple MacBook, and the Bluetooth dongle from the Altec Lansing BackBeat headsetPlantronics 906/R US BackBeat Headphones.  The Bluetooth set-up was easy on all the devices; you simply turn the speakers on and the power light flashes to indicate that it is in discovery mode.  From there simply link it up with whatever device you are trying to stream from using the Bluetooth set-up in that device.  The TENQA makes little tones to let you know it has successfully connected.  I'm not sure how many devices the TENQA can remember, but all four of my devices remained in the TENQA's memory and did not have to be reinstalled.  If you are streaming music from an iPhone the speakers will fade out and in when you answer and hang up on calls.  You cannot listen to phone conversations over the speakers.  You can walk about thirty feet from the unit before the connection drops out.Sound quality from the TENQA is not the greatest.  There is no bass to speak of, but that is expected in this type of speaker system, however even the vocals sound garbled and crackly.  Complicated Pop songs sound especially muddled.  I tried connecting via Bluetooth and 3.5mm mini jack and there was no difference in sound quality.  Overall, it sounds a bit like a clock radio.  I've used other portable speaker systems in the past, and while they too did not have much in the way of bass, the vocals were clear at moderate volumes.  Still, I will say that the TENQA is able to play at a pretty loud volume before sounding completely garbled.All in all... the Bluetooth connectivity works extremely well, too bad about the sound quality issues.03/19/2010 Update: I'm really fond of using the TENQA to listen to audio podcasts.

A100WO06OQR8BQ,B0097CZBH4,"Duffer. ""Bo""","[2, 11]","This is a comedy of errors but I am writing it in case anyone else runs into any of the same situations. My wife and I have excellent cell phone service with Consumer Cellular (CC), a no contract provider. I had bought her a Motorola Bravo from them and they sent a regular size sim card which works perfectly. My wife's Chrysler 300C was starting to require many repairs and she was wanting to replace it with a Jeep.  I bought her a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited but her Motorola Bravo is not compatible with the Jeep Voice Command System. I decided to go all out and bought her an unlocked iphone 5 which I expected to be compatible with both the Jeep Voice Command System and with our carrier, Consumer Cellular. My only concern was how to get the regular sim card in my wife's Motorola Bravo cell phone down to nano size to fit the Apple. However, I figured that CC would have a solution such as sending a nano sim card and deactivating the Motorola Bravo sim card. As I wrote, I just took it for granted that this allegedly latest and greatest engineering wonder (according to the ads) would be compatible with both the Jeep and CC. So I ordered the outrageously priced unlocked iphone 5. As usual, Amazon quickly processed my order and notified me that the phone had been shipped.I called CC to request a nano sim and was told by two different reps that the iphone 5 is not compatible with their service. I decided that I would keep CC as my server but when the iphone 5 arrived I would take it down to Walmart and sign my wife up for StraightTalk which is also a no contract server and which advertises the iphone 5 in their ads. The phone arrived in a small box, the kind that has a tear-off strip along one edge. There was no packing in the box. One end of the box was open and the cellophane wrapping was torn and disheveled. I had no way of testing the phone to check for internal damage and I had enough drama so I sent it back and bought my wife a Samsung Focus 2 for about one fourth the price of the iphone 5. I called CC and they shipped a micro sim which should arrive in a few days. Obviously CC must believe that this phone is compatible with them but as for the jeep it is anyones guess.This is where my soap opera ends as far as this review is concerned. The moral of the story is that it would behoove anyone who is in the market for a 2014 vehicle with Voice Command features or is considering a new cell phone which would be used with your existing carrier or would be paired with your vehicle to do a thorough amount of research to avoid duplicating my experiences. One final note. My cell phone is a Sony Xperia P which I bought from Amazon. It works perfectly with CC and pairs and connects perfectly with my wife's Jeep.

Smooth protective screen protector. It almost feels and functions just like the actual screen.3. the TPU soft outer case provides shock absorbing properties, just in case you are clumsy like me and drop it all the time.4. There are even plugs built into the design to protect any dirt from getting in (charger and headphones).It is easy to install and is very durable. Oh I almost forgot, it is water resistant.

A17OF6WF11SFPG,B0088U4YAG,"Dr. Doodle ""Dr. Doodle""","[0, 0]","What got my attention on this little unit is that it reportedly works on both 12volt and 24volt systems so it would work on small older general aviation aircraft, old Cessna's etc. These older aircraft nearly all have a cigarette lighter similar to many cars. Sounds weird but there it is. Anyway, having that function is quite handy and could even be used in a rental aircraft.As usual, Amazon worked great and this device was packed appropriately, arrived as expected so I'd say the vendor was great too. Now, I must point out that all was well so I didn't need to contact the vendor with a problem. These days especially, how good a vendor is, how honorable they are, etc is not known until something goes wrong. How they deal with that piece of customer service is very telling one way or the other. Amazon is very good with that stuff even with them being a huge company.

The problem with most belt carriers is that the case will frequently slip off the belt, particularly after arising from a sitting position, sending the case and iphone ignominiously to the floor.

There is a hole in the earphone flap, of dubious purpose, that doesn't line up with the earphone receptacle on the phone; even if it were aligned, the thick flap would prevent seating of most plugs. However, simply flipping up the flap provides excellent access to the socket. The flap covering the connector on the bottom of the phone is diffiult to close, and does not appear destined for a long life.

Amazon sellsT5 T6 Philips Slotted Screwdriver Opening Tool Set for Cell Phonefor a reasonable price, if you don't already have a T5 Torx screwdriver.  To release the back cover of the phone, so it'll slide off, you'll need to stick the end of a paper clip into the tiny hole in the upper right-corner of the phone's back while sliding the back cover downward.  Set the cover aside.Once you remove the phone's back cover, carefully peel the sticker off of the back of the battery and set it aside.  Holding the phone upright you'll find a small, soft, black rectangular insulator at the bottom right end of the battery.  Carefully lift and remove the insulator with your fingernail, which will expose two tiny screws.  That's where your T5 Torx screwdriver is needed.  Remove the two tiny screws and set them aside.In many Droid 4 phones the battery has been stuck in place with an elastic adhesive.  If your battery is stuck, carefully slide a thin plastic spudger between the battery and the phone, being very careful NOT to bend the battery.  Once you've broken the adhesive, the battery should easily lift out.  This new battery will fit into the exact same spot from which the old battery came.  Then use the tiny screws to connect the new battery through its flex cable to the phone's terminals, replace the black rectangular insulator and carefully re-apply the sticker.

A33WFRICMYRPT6,B00BR772P6,"Amazon Customer ""Potius mori quam foedari!""","[0, 0]","The Kyocera Torque arrived yesterday and I've spent about 10 hours going over it. Initial verdict: a solid performer that has some real pluses and a few downsides (full disclosure: my review is written having come from theHTC EVO LTE (Sprint), theSamsung Galaxy S4, Black (Sprint), and theSamsung Galaxy Note II, Titanium (Sprint).The Torque comes surrounded by a tough slightly-rubberized plastic case that seems to be somewhere between theOtterBox Commuter Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Frustration-Free Packaging - Black (Black/Black)and theOtterBox Defender Series Case for Samsung Galaxy S4 - Frustration-Free Packaging - Black (Black/Black)(but it doesn't have the holster like the Defender case does. For that I'm ordering theKyocera Torque Case with Belt Clip Holster Combo by PROTECH for Kyocera e6710). Even with the integrated shock protection, the Torque is very light and feels really good in the hand (doesn't want to slip out or feel overly small or large). All the buttons seem well-placed (save one). The Torque supposedly is (at least) water-resistant (but I'm not going to check out that feature!).Speaking of buttons/keys, like the HTC Evo the ""back"" key is on the left and the ""settings"" key is on the right (Samsung has the opposite setup). Given that I use the S4 and Note 2 now, it was awkward for a few minutes as I got re-accustomed to the ""reversed"" setup. Unlike the Samsungs and the HTC, the keys (to include the ""home"" key) are ""hard keys"" (meaning they are real buttons, not virtual buttons). I mentioned button placement (above) and said that I found all but one satisfactory. The ""save one"" button is the DirectConnect (""walkie-talkie"") button on the left side. Marked by yellow (I guess so that it can be found easier?), it was found far too easily as I used the phone. Granted, I have never used a DirectConnect phone, so it could be that I wouldn't keep stumbling over it as I got used to it. At this point, however, I disabled it so as not to drive me mad (you can map the button to perform a number of functions if you don't have or plan to get DirectConnect). On the top are the speaker and power/lock buttons, as well as the headphone jack. On the right side is a camera button. On the left side is the volume and DC buttons. On the bottom is the charging/micro USB port. The SIM card and microSD card are accessed by ""unscrewing"" the back panel (the SD card slot is accessed by removing the battery). All possible water entry points (charging port, headphone jack, buttons, and back panel) have rubber/rubberized seals.Speaking of the back panel, exercise caution. The back plate is thin plastic and the screw is not really a screw: it is a silver-coated plastic knob that you turn 1/4 turn with a coin to open the back. If the screw slot is north-south (up-down), then the back plate is locked; if east-west (left-right), then unlocked. You unlock the back plate by turning the screw 1/4 turn counter-clockwise. The screw stays on the back as the panel is removed.The OS (as of the writing of the review) is Android 4.1.2 (higher than what the Amazon page says it has). I was pleasantly surprised to find a phone that has ZERO bloatware and minimal (if at all) skinning. Compared to what the larger manufacturers like Samsung, HTC, or LG put on top of the OS, I found this minimalist approach refreshing. As such, I was surprised to see the number of available ringtones and notification tones (a rough estimate: 80 ringtones to choose from!).The touchscreen is very responsive,though not flawless (I found that it did not always respond as fast as my S4, but that could be the result of the thicker glass used (?). The camera is what should be considered the absolute minimum these days (actually, I find the 5.0 MP rear and 1.2 MP front cameras substandard). The literature says is takes up to a 32GB microSD card, but it may take a larger one (I may check that out later on at some point). But with only a 5.0 MP camera, I'm not sure you would need anything larger than 32GB (I also can't imagine anyone loading this phone up with music or videos).The RAM (only 1 GB)/ROM (only 4GB) combo means that the reasonable 1.2 GHz CPU doesn't have much to play with (so don't plan on loading up on zillions of apps unless you want to fiddle around with an SD card manager app), but what it does it seems to do well.The phone hooked up to my wireless network without issue (I wish that there was a ""show password"" option in that I huse a very long password and if you're not careful it's easy to make a mistake and cause you to re-enter the password). I have not yet had the opportunity to put the GPS function to the test or use the phone in fringe coverage areas to see how good the reception/antenna is. If the performance is substandard I'll update this review (if you don't read anything negative, then all was/is well).In the end, the Kyocera Torque is a solid performer for (as the Amazon description says) someone who works in construction, spends a significant amount of time in the great outdoors, or a parent with young kids who might be worried about slopping baby stuff onto the phone. It doesn't promise much beyond being a solid, rugged phone, but what it does promise to do it does well. I have been more than pleasantly surprised and look forward to putting it through its paces (and as I am out on the water quite a bit kayaking, this phone seems to be just the ticket!).",4.0,Very Nice (Especially If You Don't Need The Latest Tech Or Gadgets),1393372800,"02 26, 2014",the kyocera torque arrived yesterday and ive spent about  hours going over it initial verdict a solid performer that has some real pluses and a few downsides full disclosure my review is written having come from thehtc evo lte sprint thesamsung galaxy s black sprint and thesamsung galaxy note ii titanium sprintthe torque comes surrounded by a tough slightlyrubberized plastic case that seems to be somewhere between theotterbox commuter series case for samsung galaxy s  frustrationfree packaging  black blackblackand theotterbox defender series case for samsung galaxy s  frustrationfree packaging  black blackblackbut it doesnt have the holster like the defender case does for that im ordering thekyocera torque case with belt clip holster combo by protech for kyocera e even with the integrated shock protection the torque is very light and feels really good in the hand doesnt want to slip out or feel overly small or large all the buttons seem wellplaced save one the torque supposedly is at least waterresistant but im not going to check out that featurespeaking of buttonskeys like the htc evo the back key is on the left and the settings key is on the right samsung has the opposite setup given that i use the s and note  now it was awkward for a few minutes as i got reaccustomed to the reversed setup unlike the samsungs and the htc the keys to include the home key are hard keys meaning they are real buttons not virtual buttons i mentioned button placement above and said that i found all but one satisfactory the save one button is the directconnect walkietalkie button on the left side marked by yellow i guess so that it can be found easier it was found far too easily as i used the phone granted i have never used a directconnect phone so it could be that i wouldnt keep stumbling over it as i got used to it at this point however i disabled it so as not to drive me mad you can map the button to perform a number of functions if you dont have or plan to get directconnect on the top are the speaker and powerlock buttons as well as the headphone jack on the right side is a camera button on the left side is the volume and dc buttons on the bottom is the chargingmicro usb port the sim card and microsd card are accessed by unscrewing the back panel the sd card slot is accessed by removing the battery all possible water entry points charging port headphone jack buttons and back panel have rubberrubberized sealsspeaking of the back panel exercise caution the back plate is thin plastic and the screw is not really a screw it is a silvercoated plastic knob that you turn  turn with a coin to open the back if the screw slot is northsouth updown then the back plate is locked if eastwest leftright then unlocked you unlock the back plate by turning the screw  turn counterclockwise the screw stays on the back as the panel is removedthe os as of the writing of the review is android  higher than what the amazon page says it has i was pleasantly surprised to find a phone that has zero bloatware and minimal if at all skinning compared to what the larger manufacturers like samsung htc or lg put on top of the os i found this minimalist approach refreshing as such i was surprised to see the number of available ringtones and notification tones a rough estimate  ringtones to choose fromthe touchscreen is very responsivethough not flawless i found that it did not always respond as fast as my s but that could be the result of the thicker glass used  the camera is what should be considered the absolute minimum these days actually i find the  mp rear and  mp front cameras substandard the literature says is takes up to a gb microsd card but it may take a larger one i may check that out later on at some point but with only a  mp camera im not sure you would need anything larger than gb i also cant imagine anyone loading this phone up with music or videosthe ram only  gbrom only gb combo means that the reasonable  ghz cpu doesnt have much to play with so dont plan on loading up on zillions of apps unless you want to fiddle around with an sd

A6HOWM08PLFZ5,B00428N9M2,Michelle Rayburn,"[0, 0]","I've always wanted to find a pair of headphones that fit my smaller ears that wasn't sound canceling. I hoped these might be the ones, but I'm sad to say, they hurt my ears. I just couldn't find a comfortable way to fit them in. Although, every so often I could get them just right and wear them for a little while. I tried the alternate way of wearing them mentioned in the directions where they hook over and around the top of the ear but that didn't help.However, Admittedly, my ears are smaller than most people's. If you have larger ears and you can wear the earphones that come with an iPod, you'll find these similar in fit. Having the switch on the line is nice for stopping and starting your music while you are listening.I wasn't really able to try out the microphone feature on the headphones. My iPod has a built in external mic, so that picked up the sound by default when I tried these for facetime chat. And my computer has a built-in mic too, so when I tried using them on Skype with my laptop, the computer picked up the sound externally, not on the mic. I don't have a phone that fits this size headphones to try them out on to see how they work for connecting and disconnecting phone calls with the line switch. When wearing the headphones in the over-ear position, the mic is up near the ear lobe, so I don't know how well it would pick up anyway.There are some big pluses about these headphones. The sound quality is very good and they have a very full sound. I could hear guitar fret noise on one song that was extremely clear and precise. The cord looks sturdy and well made (feels like rubber, but they call it a cloth cord). The info says they are tangle free, but mine still get tangled up, although, they untangle pretty easy. And like I said, he switch in the line is nice. You can turn your music on and off with one click right on the headphones if someone comes by and asks a question while you're listening. A double click on the switch advances to the next song. A cool feature.Because of the poor fit, I can't see wearing these while biking. They just don't stay in my ears well enough. I did discover one trick though. To get them to fit, I had to treat my ears like a notch and slide the ear bud from the top of my ear down into place. I guess wearing them is a little like putting a puzzle together.",4.0,Great sound but a little uncomfortable for smaller ears,1313452800,"08 16, 2011",ive always wanted to find a pair of headphones that fit my smaller ears that wasnt sound canceling i hoped these might be the ones but im sad to say they hurt my ears i just couldnt find a comfortable way to fit them in although every so often i could get them just right and wear them for a little while i tried the alternate way of wearing them mentioned in the directions where they hook over and around the top of the ear but that didnt helphowever admittedly my ears are smaller than most peoples if you have larger ears and you can wear the earphones that come with an ipod youll find these similar in fit having the switch on the line is nice for stopping and starting your music while you are listeningi wasnt really able to try out the microphone feature on the headphones my ipod has a built in external mic so that picked up the sound by default when i tried these for facetime chat and my computer has a builtin mic too so when i tried using them on skype with my laptop the computer picked up the sound externally not on the mic i dont have a phone that fits this size headphones to try them out on to see how they work for connecting and disconnecting phone calls with the line switch when wearing the headphones in the overear position the mic is up near the ear lobe so i dont know how well it would pick up anywaythere are some big pluses about these headphones the sound quality is very good and they have a very full sound i could hear guitar fret noise on one song that was extremely clear and precise the cord looks sturdy and well made feels like rubber but they call it a cloth cord the info says they are tangle free but mine still get tangled up although they untangle pretty easy and like i said he switch in the line is nice you can turn your music on and off with one click right on the headphones if someone comes by and asks a question while youre listening a double click on the switch advances to the next song a cool featurebecause of the poor fit i cant see wearing these while biking they just dont stay in my ears well enough i did discover one trick though to get them to fit i had to treat my ears like a notch and slide the ear bud from the top of my ear down into place i guess wearing them is a little like putting a puzzle together,joy,joy

A1RK51PI9UESR0,B0092KJ9BU,spacejumper,"[1, 1]","Very nice except apparent range and stutter issue. It seems to be very well built and thought out. The optional case is a great idea as well. The following is from my writeup on using the Voyager Legend with the Samsung GS3 which includes other information which may help purchasers who might otherwise return the unit due to common misunderstandings.In particular... RE: Voyager Legend specific issues...1) Voyager periodically disconnects. However, I suspect it's a power saving feature? It connects again at the tap of the Call button. I did not find this bothersome.2) I think the Voyager has a range issue. Sound can &#34;stutter&#34; at times, especially if not right next to phone. It's range seems more limited than it should be. Other than that it appears to be a well designed product. I plan to ask the Plantronics folks about it before I decide if I keep it. This is the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars at this point.3) At first I had major voice command issues with it that almost made me return it until I realized the cause and fixes. The issues appear to be either or both of the following...a) As discussed below the software installed on the Galaxy S3 phone, and what app is the default to act on bluetooth call button actions. I strongly feel this would be true of other bluetooth headsets and some other phones as well!b) Operator misunderstanding of the Voyager Call vs. Voice Command buttons as well as the fact that the call button depends on the phone whereas the Voice button is more the Voyager itself or the optional Plantronics Vocalyst app on the phone. (I did NOT install or test that app.) I had the same strange number issue others reported until I understood the 2 buttons. If you hit the voice command button you can only make 2 call commands...1) &#34;Call Vocalyst&#34;: If the app is not installed, it appears to call 831-480-2388.2) &#34;Call Information&#34;: This calls 866-949-1784.I am not sure what these are. (In a blog comment someone mentioned Bing Business Search but I am not sure.)----------Below is my full 6/15/13 writeup: &#34;Samsung Galaxy S3 and Bluetooth Voice Commands&#34;(Tested with Plantronics Voyager Legend, Sprint GS3 (SPH-L710), Android 4.1.2 MD4, NOVA Launcher Pro)I have found quite a few issues with the GS3 using voice commands via a bluetooth device. I believe Samsung has some work to do on S-Voice and Google on their Google Now Search!On the GS3, Samsung S-Voice is the default responder to voice commands received from bluetooth devices (such as the Voyager Legend). I will try to explain the issues along with fixes via alternate voice recognition applications and settings. All tests were performed with a Plantronics Voyager Legend. However, I would expect similar issues with other bluetooth devices. In the process I also found a Voyager Legend issue unrelated to voice commands. What follows are the results of my hours of testing and note taking...1) Default Samsung S-Voice (v10.1 (1000) system app)...This default application does not appear to &#34;play&#34; well with bluetooth voice commands. If the contact has more than one number, it calls default without asking. Does not even confirm it got the correct contact and you may dial the wrong number! It also does not play well with PIN Lock Screens! Who wants to enter a PIN while driving! (Pattern Lock may be OK? I can't recall what I found.) My experience is with the Voyager. I have seen other blog entries confirming this for other bluetooth devices! (Hint: If you insist on using S-Voice, turn OFF missed events announce in its settings. I have seen complaints about that feature.)What Next?...After my conclusion that S-Voice was not really practical for bluetooth use I wanted to try other applications as the default bluetooth voice command provider. Doing so requires that you remove the default setting to use S-Voice as the provider. The normal method of going into Settings / Manage Applications / S-Voice and clearing its defaults does not seem to do the trick. I had to Disable S-Voice completely (from that same menu)! After you disable it, the first time a bluetooth device asks for voice command support you will be given choice of defaults. This will only offer Google Now Voice Search if you have not installed any other such apps.At this point I will discuss voice commands with Google Now as well as a couple of 3rd party voice assistant applications. Note that if an app is set as default &#34;Always&#34; rather than &#34;Once&#34;, some apps seem to have fewer problems. Even though you may just want to try an app, it is better to set the app as the &#34;Always&#34;. If you later want to switch to another default app, you will have to clear the current default app's &#34;Defaults&#34; (Settings / Manage Applications / [Current Default App] / Clear Defaults). To go back to S-Voice you will first have to re-enable it.----2) Google (Now) Search (v2.5.8.675703 system app)...First open Google Now. Select Settings / Voice and be sure &#34;Bluetooth headset Records audio thru headset if available&#34; is checked then close out Now. Next, press Voyager call button and select &#34;Google Search&#34; as the default Always. Now the Voyager call button brings up a grey &#34;Voice Dialer&#34; screen and prompts audibly to say Call [contact name] and the mic icon goes red. However, it does not hear the audio and the screen disappears! (If bluetooth audio thru headset is then turned off then it does not appear to hear any audio via phone mic or Voyager bluetooth EVEN if opened via a Voice Search icon! It takes exiting then a second try of the icon to get a response. (At one point Now also hung until first reboot after set as default. This might have been due to a Dragon setting? Not confirmed. See Utter section below.)Basically, using bluetooth control seems to totally confuse Google Now Voice Search on the GS3 to the point of being totally unusable!----3) Dragon Mobile Assistant (v3.1.0 build 86 from Playstore)...Dragon generally works great via bluetooth just like when manually triggered.Setup: First set it as the default. (However, it does appears you can test Dragon even using the Just Once answer to the default prompt.) Next be sure to set &#34;Auto Enable Driver Mode to Bluetooth&#34;!How it responds to bluetooth Call button: It prompts for a command. Respond with Call [contact name]. If the contact has more than one number, it asks which one to call. If only one number it at least tells who it is calling, but does NOT audible ask for a confirmation of the correct contact. The screen gives a visual Cancel option. It even dials with a PIN screen lock which S-Voice apparently will not do. HOWEVER, if the screen is locked WITH a PIN, and you hit the Voyager Call button to cancel the call, it does not cancel, the screen goes blank and can't bring up the lock screen. The call stays connected for a bit? and then the phone reboots. When it came back up, the PIN lock screen would not respond to the keyboard. Had to hit power button and select restart to do a true restart to fix it and get back into the phone!The above is NOT an issue with a PATTERN screen lock. It dials OK and the phone call screen displays over the lock screen. If you hit the Voyager Call button to cancel the call, it cancels OK. Also a slight issue if only on battery and not charging: Dragon stays over the lock screen which never goes off. I did not try any of the other lock options.----4) Utter! (from Playstore)Utter! also seems to work great. If the contact has more than one number, it asks which one to call. However, if only one number for the contact, it does NOT ask for a confirmation of the correct contact. (At least with settings I tried.) I need to review Utter settings. It is an awesome app with lots of choices and customizations that should be ideal for custom mobile commands. It even dials with a PIN screen lock which S-Voice apparently will not do. It does NOT open in foreground when responding. I suspect this means it will not interfere with Navigation apps and require screen action to bring them back to the foreground? Awesome!Minor Issue solved!: If driving mode turned off/on by Utter command while bluetooth was connected, Utter seemed to hang. After a reboot it had other problems until I opened settings then exited. Then it seemed fine until I ran into an issue where it verbally said it had an issue. (I forget what it said.) It only had problems when connected to bluetooth. If I turned off the Voyager, Utter responds OK to the phone mic.CAUSE and FIX: It was NOT Utter! Dragon was not default but its Auto Enable Driver Mode setting still had Bluetooth checked! Unchecked that Dragon setting and the Utter issues were gone! I believe the apps were competing to handle the bluetooth commands.MY CONCLUSION...1) I believe Samsung has some work to do on S-Voice and Google on their Google Now Search!2) Utter! has awesome command capability! It also has the best detailed audible feedback response I have ever seen and seems to be best suited of the apps I tested with a bluetooth headset (Voyager)! I recommend it to solve the GS3 bluetooth command issues. However, it has many options which some may find overwhelming. The defaults may work OK, but I recall a few settings tweaks made it even better. Be sure to set its speech output for a good voice engine. I recommend Ivona Voice with British English add on even for Americans! Its inflections are more natural last I tested. I also use it for my default text to speech on the whole phone.3) Dragon Mobile Assistant would be my second choice if you do NOT use a PIN screen lock. However, you are more likely to call the wrong person.4) There are other voice assistant apps available which might work well but I did not test any with bluetooth.----RE: Miscellaneous Voyager Legend specific issues...1) Voyager periodically disconnects. However, I suspect it's a power saving feature? It connects again at the tap of the Call button.2) I think the Voyager has a range issue. Sound can &#34;stutter&#34; at times, especially if not right next to phone. It's range seems more limited than it should be. Other than that it appears to be a well designed product. I plan to ask the Plantronics folks about it before I decide if I keep it.3) The voice command issues with it appear to be either or both of the following...3a) As discussed above, the software installed on the Galaxy S3 phone, and what app is the default to act on bluetooth call button actions. I strongly feel this would be true of other bluetooth headsets as well!3b) Operator misunderstanding of the Voyager Call vs. Voice Command buttons as well as the fact that the call button depends on the phone whereas the Voice button is more the Voyager itself or the optional Plantronics Vocalyst app on the phone. (I did NOT install or test that app.) I had the same strange number issue others reported until I understood the 2 buttons.

(In a blog comment someone mentioned Bing Business Search but I am not sure.)It took hours to test and write this up. If I got something wrong, I apologize and welcome correction! As I said before, I believe Samsung has some work to do on S-Voice and Google on their Google Now Search! In the mean time I hope this helps some GS3 owners. This might apply to the GS4 and possibly some other phones as well?= END =",3.0,Very nice except apparent range and stutter issue,1371254400,"06 15, 2013",very nice except apparent range and stutter

A3D0A45555K1DB,B0052YFYFK,"Ronald E. Donofero ""TLC Yoda""","[0, 0]","Amazon is going to be angry with me because I usually buy EVERYTHING from them.  This time, I needed this faster than I would be able to get it via mail - so I bought it from a retailer and paid $10.00 more for it than if I had bought it from Amazon (sorry for going to another retailer on this one Amazon).I am using this product (mainly) on an iPhone 3GS.I am in LOVE with this product.My boss allows me to use my iPhone to listen to podcasts and watch movies (in the background) while I work (as long as I do my job and stay productive!).  Recently, a co-worker moved near my work area and didn't like some of the things that I listen to.  So I went to earbuds.  Worked out great, but the wires were in my way.  So I needed a wireless audio solution.Being a very technical person - my first thought was that if you TRANSMIT something - there will be a DELAY.  So I was concerned that audio/video would not sync up properly.After much research - I chose this product.Turned out to be a GREAT choice!  The audio/video has ZERO delay issues.  Now I HAVE seen a delay problem a FEW times.  I've only had this problem AFTER pairing the device with ANOTHER source.  Something gets out of sync. - but if you go to settings (on the iPhone) and disable the device and then re-enable it - the delay disappears.Now then - a few pro's and con's:Pro's:1.  EASY PAIRING.  My iPhone paired with it quickly and easily.2.  Charges FAST - I think I had it on the charger for around 10 minutes.  The light went out (indicating full charge) and I thought 'wow!  Really?  Already?'.3.  Long battery life.  I haven't had them long enough to say for sure - but they advertise 10 hours of play time.  I've been on them at LEAST 6 hours now and they are doing fine.4.  Very comfortable.Con's:1.  The audio quality is better than expected for a bluetooth device - BUT  - They do NOT match my sony earbuds.  They don't have quite the bass ""thump"" or clarity.  That said - the sound quality IS impressive for a wireless device and it is beyond acceptable - I'd even repeat that impressive is the right word for the audio.2.  There is no 2.  And con number 1 is very minor unless you are a die-hard audiofile.  The sound quality is beyond what I expected for a wireless device.Hope this review helps.  And to anyone who doesn't need it as fast as I did - you SHOULD buy from Amazon.  They have the best price.- Ron*** Added Information ***Ok - it hasn't ever charged QUITE as fast as the first time.

A31HE83MU98GBV,B00A6WWPAK,Gadget Girl,"[0, 0]","I have always used an Otterbox Defender with my iPhone.  I was shocked at the light weight of this product!  It is a little more difficult to remove, but the case is water resistant to 6+ feet and keeps out dirt/sand, etc.  You need a coin to open the case once it is shut (or something else to pry it open.  It was a little tricky the first time, but worked well afterwards.  In the box is a headphone adapter to keep the headphone port sealed, but still gives you the ability to use headphones.  This will be great for the beach.  With two young children, the more protection I can get for my phone, the better.  This is much lighter/sleeker than the Otterbox, provides protection for the screen itself.  The only minor quibble is you will want to make sure you have any tiny specks of dirt/lint cleaned before you seal it up.  It comes with a cleaning cloth, but I think a little screen cleaning solution will help keep any small pieces of lint off of it in the future.  I will be switching over to this case full time.  One note:  The AmazonBasics lightning cable does NOT fit the adapter port while the case is one - the base is too wide.  This does fit the standard regular lightning adapter cord and has a flap to open for easy charging.  The headphone port has a small screw you unscrew which I am going to try very hard not to lose! :)  (NOTE:  Because I have since lost the headphone port screw, I found out there is an extra screw attached to the headphone adapter.  Also, extras of both items can be ordered for relatively cheap on Amazon).UPDATE:  I got a 2nd case (in black) and for some reason that one (which I know was a legitimate Lifeproof case) was sometimes difficult for the other person to hear me.  I kept getting complaints that I sounded like I was underwater.  I think it's due to the way the microphone is obstructed by the waterproofing.  It's odd that the White & Gray case, which I used for a few months, did not have this issue, but the black one did.  Both were real (not counterfeit) cases obtained directly from Amazon.  I have actually switched back to the Otterbox since I (foolishly) gave my husband the gray case and others were having trouble hearing me with the black case.  My parents have used Lifeproof 4/4S cases for over a year and I have no issues hearing them.  So I don't quite understand why some are like this and others aren't.

After a few days of using the Travelpak, it has proven itself to be quite a handy way to keep my iPhone and iPad mini charged.The Travelpak is a little bulky, but not too heavy and it has folding outlet prongs that make it easy to throw it in my purse or bag when traveling. It has a white ambient led light that indicates the charging stage of the Travelpak when plugged into a wall outlet and to fully charge the unit only takes a couple of hours. It has a power on button located on the side of the unit that must be pressed when using it to charge your phone or tablet.

A3V5F050GVZ56Q,B00DBEK0TI,Dre,"[0, 0]","I was provided an Amplim Eiffel iPhone 5 Case (Blue Metallic Color) for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review, so this is what I found.What You Should Know Before You Buy:&#9830; Thin, stylish case that looks good and doesn't add much bulk.&#9830; Solid plastic case that offers primarily scratch protection to the body of the phone.&#9830; Perfect, tight fit.&#9830; All buttons and ports are easily accessible.&#9830; The stand looks cool, but isn't very sturdy and is set-up for for portrait viewing of your phone.  More ""form over function"".&#9830; No screen protection with no raised bezel around the screen.&#9830; No internal cushion so minimal impact protection.Detailed Review:&#9830; Background - I have a Black iPhone 5 that I keep in an Incipio Dual PRO Case (Incipio Dual PRO for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Obsidian Black/ Obsidian Black).  The Incipio is a great blend of protection and size.  It has a silicone internal shell for cushion covered by a hard outer shell.  It adds some bulk, but not a crazy amount like an Otterbox.  When reviewing a case, I always think of my Incipio case for my comparisons.&#9830; Look and Installation - The product came in a clear hanging display box with minimal product information on it. Inside the box was only the case encased in a plastic holder that slid out of the box. The back of the blue metallic colored case has a raised up image of the Eiffel Tower that looks pretty cool and is tightly molded into the case.  The bottom half of the Eiffel Tower insert tilts out and acts as a phone stand.  The case is solid and slightly flexible making installation pretty easy.  Once on, the case fit perfectly.  It wrapped around the back and the sides, but did not extend past the screen at all, maintaining a fairly thin look, but providing no screen protection.  Once the case is on, it looks nice and adds only a little bit of bulk while having a fairly solid build.&#9830; Use and Performance - Once the case was installed, the case part worked as intended.  The top and bottom are open with the case wrapping around the corners to hold the case on.  There are also holes for access to the side buttons and a hole for the camera.  All buttons and ports were easily accessible.  The case is strong and offers a lot of scratch protection, but that is about it.  Since it doesn't have any kind of cushion with it being direct case to phone contact, you shouldn't expect much in the way of major drop or impact protection.  Also with the case only covering the sides and not extending past the screen at all, you really don't have any screen protection either.  The protection is fine as long as that is what you are looking for.  The bottom half of the Eiffel Tower stand piece tilts out and supports the phone in a Portrait (Tall) view.  It looks good, but is a little too weak to support much pressing on the phone.  It flexes quite a bit.  It also isn't built to support the phone in a Landscape (Wide, Horizontal) view.  The very bottom of the stand legs pop off and can give you a little better tilt when supporting the phone sideways, but then you run the risk of losing this little piece of the stand.  The case is good, but the stand could use some improvement.Conclusion:Overall, this is a nice case that provides scratch protection to the body.  It is not intended to provide major drop or impact protection and it is not intended to provide screen protection.  The Eiffel Tower stand design on the back looks really cool and will most likely be a discussion point with your friends but the stand function is only OK because it is a little too flexible for my liking and only really supports Portrait viewing.  The stand to me seems like more ""form over function"".  If you are looking for major damage protection covering the entire phone or a really strong stand, you should look elsewhere.  If you are looking for a cool case with some unique features that provides some basic iPhone protection, this case is worth a look.",4.0,What You Should Know Before You Buy!,1377820800,"08 30, 2013",i was provided an amplim eiffel iphone  case blue metallic color for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review so this is what i foundwhat you should know before you buy thin stylish case that looks good and doesnt add much bulk solid plastic case that offers primarily scratch protection to the body of the phone perfect tight fit all buttons and ports are easily accessible the stand looks cool but isnt very sturdy and is setup for for portrait viewing of your phone  more form over function no screen protection with no raised bezel around the screen no internal cushion so minimal impact protectiondetailed review background  i have a black iphone  that i keep in an incipio dual pro case incipio dual pro for iphone   retail packaging  obsidian black obsidian black  the incipio is a great blend of protection and size  it has a silicone internal shell for cushion covered by a hard outer shell  it adds some bulk but not a crazy amount like an otterbox  when reviewing a case i always think of my incipio case for my comparisons look and installation  the product came in a clear hanging display box with minimal product information on it inside the box was only the case encased in a plastic holder that slid out of the box the back of the blue metallic colored case has a raised up image of the eiffel tower that looks pretty cool and is tightly molded into the case  the bottom half of the eiffel tower insert tilts out and acts as a phone stand  the case is solid and slightly flexible making installation pretty easy  once on the case fit perfectly  it wrapped around the back and the sides but did not extend past the screen at all maintaining a fairly thin look but providing no screen protection  once the case is on it looks nice and adds only a little bit of bulk while having a fairly solid build use and performance  once the case was installed the case part worked as intended  the top and bottom are open with the case wrapping around the corners to hold the case on  there are also holes for access to the side buttons and a hole for the camera  all buttons and ports were easily accessible  the case is strong and offers a lot of scratch protection but that is about it  since it doesnt have any kind of cushion with it being direct case to phone contact you shouldnt expect much in the way of major drop or impact protection  also with the case only covering the sides and not extending past the screen at all you really dont have any screen protection either  the protection is fine as long as that is what you are looking for  the bottom half of the eiffel tower stand piece tilts out and supports the phone in a portrait tall view  it looks good but is a little too weak to support much pressing on the phone  it flexes quite a bit  it also isnt built to support the phone in a landscape wide horizontal view  the very bottom of the stand legs pop off and can give you a little better tilt when supporting the phone sideways but then you run the risk of losing this little piece of the stand  the case is good but the stand could use some improvementconclusionoverall this is a nice case that provides scratch protection to the body  it is not intended to provide major drop or impact protection and it is not intended to provide screen protection  the eiffel tower stand design on the back looks really cool and will most likely be a discussion point with your friends but the stand function is only ok because it is a little too flexible for my liking and only really supports portrait viewing  the stand to me seems like more form over function  if you are looking for major damage protection covering the entire phone or a really strong stand you should look elsewhere  if you are looking for a cool case with some unique features that provides some basic iphone protection this case is worth a look,joy,joy

A3T2DYBIJ8TS1V,B00EP2BYHW,"Jbro87 ""JB""","[2, 2]","Best phone I've ever had.If Apple made a big screen phone, I'd probably buy it.  Moved from an iPhone 5 to HTC One.  I was really happy with the HTC One and not looking for a new device.  Then I read a couple of reviews of the Moto X and figured I'd go check one out to see what was up.  Right off, you see the screen is big, but the device isn't.  By a lot.  I was stunned.  So, I figured I'd buy one (off-contract) during the deals Motorola was running for Black Friday just to see what I really thought.  Like I said, best phone I've ever had.PROS:Big screen - small profile.  Can't say enough about this.  This has to be close to what we'll be seeing the in the future from particularly Apple.  It's small and big at the same time.  Without getting into specifics, the Moto X screen specs out poorly from certain standpoints, but screens are up to individuals.  It's only slightly smaller than the HTC One's screen but much smaller and lighter in the hand.  Up close, I think the Moto X screen is flat out beautiful.  And I read on it a lot.Battery - first smart phone I've ever had that I can unplug from the wall in the morning and I don't have to think about the battery for the rest of the day.  Usually go to bed with between 20%-40% of the battery left.Notification system - you gotta see it to believe it - best I've ever come across.  The hands free is terrific - pull it out of my pocket and I don't need to hit any button to see: 1) the time; 2) any emails; 3) any texts; 4) ANY NOTIFICIATIONS!  Espn shows just an 'E' icon - it rocks!Speed - the speed of the device is as good as anything I've worked with.  Just don't notice any hiccups and it's proven to be amazingly stable.  Never have to reset.Sound - love the speaker on this thing and the sounds Motorola have put on the stock device are easily on par with Apple.  Okay, it's closer to Apple than anyone else has ever gotten (though HTC always did well in this area and Samsung, well, details are an afterthought with them).CONS:Camera - but not as bad as some say.  The HTC One and iPhone 5 were much better cameras, but I've gotten used to the Moto X camera and can say it's okay.  I'm the kind who likes to take a picture of a model number on the back of a device to Google it later or take pictures largely for the data I can get off the picture.  That does not work so well with this phone.  I've worked around it and it's okay.  Could be a big deal for some.  Personal pictures of family/friends/events are good enough.  But if the camera is a big deal to you, well, that might be a deal breaker for some.  Also, it is a plus to be able to twist the device to automatically go to the camera.

Why wasn't this battery included as original equipment?For the purposes of my review, it boils down to this:- As far as extended batteries go, it's not offering much over the stock battery.- But it also doesn't bloat the phone to the thickness of a loaf of bread.- You're going to want the extra juice, so you may as well pick one up.- Based on use, I've experienced no reason to doubt it delivers the claimed extra power.- Verizon/Samsung/Google really should have included this with the phone.- The battery has an NFC antenna coil on board, just like the stock battery, so near field communications / mobile payments  aren't affected (as of this writing, Google Wallet isn't officially available in the Marketplace, but can be side loaded without rooting).Do give it a couple of days of use before you make any judgments -- it takes a couple of charge cycles for the phone to ""track"" this battery properly (same with the stock battery).And last but not least, don't expect this to relieve you of having a charger (or spare battery) around for a mid-day boost at least some of the time.",4.0,"Only 13% more juice over stock, but practically 0% thicker...",1324598400,"12 23, 2011",the extended battery for samsungsgalaxy nexusis a bit on an enigmafor a powerhungry phone that it could be argued is outfitted with too small a battery an extended battery is a natural addonbut by bringing only mah extra to the table mah total this battery extends run times only   that could amount to one or two hours for the run times ive experienced anywhere from about  to  hours depending on a lot of usage factors excluding days with heavy heavy video streaming or g data tetheringhowever unlike most extended batteries that resemble an ugly wart on the back of the phone this one barely changes the profile of the phone at all  so little so that the hardshellotterbox defenderfits fine with barely an extra squeeze so how could you not want this batterybut then of course the question can be asked why wasnt this battery included as original equipmentfor the purposes of my review it boils down to this as far as extended batteries go its not offering much over the stock battery but it also doesnt bloat the phone to the thickness of a loaf of bread youre going to want the extra juice so you may as well pick one up based on use ive experienced no reason to doubt it delivers the claimed extra power verizonsamsunggoogle really should have included this with the phone the battery has an nfc antenna coil on board just like the stock battery so near field communications  mobile payments  arent affected as of this writing google wallet isnt officially available in the marketplace but can be side loaded without rootingdo give it a couple of days of use before you make any judgments  it takes a couple of charge cycles for the phone to track this battery properly same with the stock batteryand last but not least dont expect this to relieve you of having a charger or spare battery around for a midday boost at least some of the time,joy,joy

A1HRECPV2Q79BG,B00CO3HCSY,718tech,"[0, 0]","The Panavise phone holder is a pretty good product, which means that it's pretty much as good as you can expect in the category. Sadly, the category is defined by poorly made, flimsy and unreliable products, so that's not saying much. I've tried three or four of these type of holders with two different generations of iphone (3 and 5) and none are truly excellent. The Panavise is acceptable, provided you attach it to the windshield, where it gets a tight grip on the glass. On my lightly textured plastic dashboard it held for a few minutes but never felt secure. I wouldn't risk it.It's simple to operate, and adjusts to fit the phone and its power cord easily. The rubber pads included are fine for keeping your phone unscratched. I had no problem tightening the ball joint, but have to wonder about the long-term reliability of something made entirely of plastic, especially if it's left in a hot car for a while. But then, it's winter now, so time will tell. In use, the phone does shake and shimmy. Not to the extent that it'll fall out, but certainly enough to make it difficult to see the screen, if you're using it for navigation. Again, pretty much par for the product category.I do wish someone would make a truly robust holder, and charge an appropriate price. Something like the beanbag mounts available for GPS units would be great. Any suction cup product is inherently unreliable, and even the best can fail in warm or humid conditions.

AWAB7PKBO3BBT,B005HMCNO2,"FoodPornDirector ""Amazon junkie""","[25, 27]","I have to admit that I had a bit of a misperception regarding this product.  I thought that the solar panels would actually charge my iPhone battery, but it is really an auxiliary battery that gets recharged through sunlight which then charges your iPhone battery.The good:- If you spend some time outdoors, this is a great device in that you don't have to worry about finding an outlet to recharge your phone.  The solar units charge even when it is overcast.- Set-up is simple and intuitive. You slide open the case, snap your phone in, and slide it closed.- The auxiliary battery can also be charged through an outlet.- Your iphone doesn't have to be in the unit in order to be charged- extends the run-time of your iphone significantlyThe ugly:- the extra weight added to your phone, will obliterate the entire slim, cool effect of your iphone as well as giving you a flashback to the 90's when phones felt like bricks- in order to charge the unit while it is in the case, you have to place it face down and there is a very minimal buffer. I haven't scratched the face of my phone yet, but it still makes me feel uncomfortable- no way to charge or sync the iPhone itself through the port.  The solar charger uses this port itself.  Next to my bedstand, I have 2 chargers - one for the solar battery and one for the iPhone itself- the solar battery recharges through a microUSB.  I still cannot fathom why they would design something that would require an entirely different charger- as the solar battery charge winds down, it goes through this psychotic power flux which ends up turning the ""charge mode"" screen on in the iPhone on and off (the screen that shows the battery picture with power level in green). You will be driven insane by hearing the ""charging"" chime every 20 secs that can only be alleviate by decoupling the case from the iphone.- the manufacturer recommends that you NOT charge the solar battery with the iPhone in it - ?!?!? Seriously? I think this is a more of a legal disclaimer since it does heat up after sunbathing a bit.- does not charge indoors through artificial lighting, unlike most calculators.- you will get ridiculed by your coworkers and be labelled as a cellphonosauras for having such a bulky phone.  Ironic thing is that you have the coolest thing on the market. It's like driving a Ferrari with a Domino's pizza delivery sign on top.Overall, if you find yourself difficulty getting access to an outlet charger on a daily basis, this unit should come in handy in that you can harness green energy.  But I rarely use my phone enough to deplete the charge within a day and usually do fine by just recharging at night.

AGXHFCDKM5DNX,B00DPMNNUO,sonofjohn,"[1, 2]","UPDATE: i did contact InfiniApps about the problem and it turned out i had received an older version of this product with a thinner neck. They happily replaced mine with the newer, thicker-necked version, and the new one is as awesome as i had hoped it would be! I love it. There's virtually no more vibration. I'd say in comparison to my old iMagnet cradle, there's slightly more vibration due to the nature of the mount. But it is no longer noticeable or annoying. The phone stays put and is much more accessible than it was on the old windshield mount. i definitely love this new mount!If i could give this a 2.5 rating i would. I wanted to like it so bad, but i wish i had gotten something else.I previously had the iMagnet Cradle-less Magnetic Mount with Quick-snap Technology, Smartphone Car Windshield Dashboard Universal Holder which i absolutely loved. It had a sticky suction cup and powerful magnet that really locked your phone in place. I never had the mount lose suction, fall off, or drop the phone. But i was stupid and jacked up the suction cup, so i had to get another one. I didn't like that with a windshield mount i found my phone really heating up just sitting in the sun like that, so i decided to go with this instead.The idea is great. It mounts very easily in the CD slot and seems very solid. The magnet doesn't seem much different from the iMagnet mount. But, and here's the kicker, the neck leading from the CD mount to the ball swivel is just too thin. I have a Galaxy S4 with a a thin case. Installed a magnet plate inside the case AND behind the battery cover on the actual phone. But in a brand new car, on smooth roads, the thing just shakes around like crazy! Never had this issue with the iMagnet. All the connections are secure, checked and double checked, the weakness is in the neck, it's too thin and you can see it flexes and causes the phone to vibrate all over the place. It actually vibrates so much that it's constantly activating the google maps shake feature, where you shake your phone to send feedback.i still use it, but i don't like it as much as my old iMagnet one. And unless they improve the neck, i dunno... i saw a bunch of video reviews where there was no noticeable vibration, but mine is pretty bad.

A1E1LEVQ9VQNK,B0001DVQNG,J. Chambers,"[1, 1]","It's no problem charging mobile devices while you're driving, since these devices can be charged from a USB port, either built into the vehicle (newer models) or from USB chargers that fit in the vehicle's power port (aka cigarette lighter). But a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with AC power, and for those devices, a 12-volt in-vehicle power inverter is the answer. I have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers, but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop. I tried the Sabrent 75-watt inverter in my Subaru, and it worked fine for providing both AC and USB power. I used it with two of my AC-powered camera battery chargers and a AA battery charger:Canon G10 battery charger - 14 wattsNikon D3200 battery charger - 20 wattsMaha AA battery charger - 16 wattsI also used the inverter to charge my HP laptop while using the laptop. The laptop uses a maximum of 50 watts while running, which is well below the inverter's limits. While using the inverter for AC devices, I also recharged my Android smartphone with the 1A USB charging port.One caution: Every vehicle's electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicle's power port. For my Subaru Forester, the owner's manual says this is 120 watts. Trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse. I should also note that Subaru sells its own 100-watt power inverter for my vehicle, but it costs about $300, while the Sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amount.For anyone who has a need for AC power in their vehicle, the Sabrent inverter is a good option to consider. The inverter is also available in 150 watts (Sabrent 150w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C15U)) and 300 watts (Sabrent 300w Power Inverter with 2.1A-1A Dual USB Charger 12v DC to 120v AC (PW-C30U)).A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",5.0,Extraordinarily useful and much less expensive than auto manufacturers' inverters,1379376000,"09 17, 2013",its no problem charging mobile devices while youre driving since these devices can be charged from a usb port either built into the vehicle newer models or from usb chargers that fit in the vehicles power port aka cigarette lighter but a lot of small electrical appliances are only made to work with ac power and for those devices a volt invehicle power inverter is the answer i have bought dedicated power adapters for laptop computers but these are expensive and usually only work with a particular model laptop i tried the sabrent watt inverter in my subaru and it worked fine for providing both ac and usb power i used it with two of my acpowered camera battery chargers and a aa battery chargercanon g battery charger   wattsnikon d battery charger   wattsmaha aa battery charger   wattsi also used the inverter to charge my hp laptop while using the laptop the laptop uses a maximum of  watts while running which is well below the inverters limits while using the inverter for ac devices i also recharged my android smartphone with the a usb charging portone caution every vehicles electrical system has a maximum rated power that it can deliver through the vehicles power port for my subaru forester the owners manual says this is  watts trying to power a device or devices that exceed that limit will likely blow a fuse i should also note that subaru sells its own watt power inverter for my vehicle but it costs about  while the sabrent inverter is a small fraction of that amountfor anyone who has a need for ac power in their vehicle the sabrent inverter is a good option to consider the inverter is also available in  watts sabrent w power inverter with aa dual usb charger v dc to v ac pwcu and  watts sabrent w power inverter with aa dual usb charger v dc to v ac pwcua product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes,joy,joy

A1CU1APWZFR8DB,B0043M668G,Joseph or Shiloh,"[0, 0]","(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.Pros:-Easy set up.-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.-Comes with a in-car charger.-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.Cons:-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.Overall, I am pretty satisfied with this product.

A2QRXQPHDMFCQV,B000PI17MM,"SanjeevP ""Bottom Line""","[101, 114]","The concept is nice: that you carry one set of auto and wall chargers for different devices but change just the tip for each device. In practice, I found the following problems:1. Each charger is 3 components: wall/auto unit, cable, and the tip that goes into the device and these 3 components do not fit securely, especially the cable keeps coming out of the wall or auto unit.2. The charger does not come with even one tip. So make sure you order the tip for your device along with the charger. They should have at least enclosed one common mini usb tip in the package. Charger itself is cheap but tips are very expensive - that is where they rip you off.3. You get only one cable. So you have to carry the same cable to your car and then home. Why couldn't they have 2 cables in the package? Keep one in car and one in the house.4. Build is very cheap and shows poor fabrication.5 Instead of a well made bag/box to keep 4 components, it comes with a cheap nylon bag which does not hold different tips, chargers etc snugly. They keep falling out.The result is that this product leaves you with a bad taste. I would have been better off buying 2 separate chargers -auto and wall- for $5 each from cellularfactory than paying $30 for iGo which comes with only one cable.

But then there's the bad...The material they chose to make the case out of is quite slippery, and doesn't offer any grip like a normal rubber or silicone case might.  This kind of defeats the purpose of the case: protecting your phone.  The case is there on the off chance you're going to drop the phone.  Well, your chances of dropping your phone just went up due to the lack of friction the case material provides.The other nag I have with this case is it requires you to have the phone clipped to your belt in a purely vertical fashion - the belt clip doesn't rotate at all.  This requires you to place the phone directly on your side so that when you bend, sit, or squat, the phone isn't pressing into your stomach or lap.  The case, new at least, has enough pressure on it to keep the phone secure even if you tip it upside down, so I'd like the option of rotating the orientation of the phone 90 degrees for more comfort.

AX05DBU8IRUWY,B00B1UQBGA,C. Schmidt,"[1, 1]","*Disclosure: I was contacted and given a sample of this product by uNu*I see lots of battery packs, as well as plenty of extended life batteries w/cases.  This one, which is similar to theuNu Aero Seriestries to make a balance between adding size and being of value, while at the same time trying to work within the limitations of what what can do with the fruit of Apple.  Like the Aero series, I think uNu did a good job at meeting their goals with this product, but could have done a couple of things better.  The case itself is a nice snug fit, not easily dislodged once it's wrapped around your phone.  Fatter than the Aero Series model, true, but packing a bit more battery too.  For whatever reason, uNu decided against using a lightening connector on the outside of the case for charging and syncing, and went with micro USB instead.  You can still charge and sync, no problem, but if you bought extra lightening cables, extra iPhone specific cables, those are going ot be useless with this case.  Due to the the iPhone not having a user replaceable battery, the DX case acts as its own entity. Clearly written in the instructions, it's made plain that in order to get the extra juice, one must manually turn it on.  For those that...uhm...don't read instructions, it's not at all obvious.  It would be nice if the whole thing worked together with the phone a bit better.  Like maybe an app that could monitor the phone's battery and then kick on the extra one as needed.  Not being an Apple developer myself, I suspect that Apple does not allow the level of access to the hardware needed to make this possible.  Also worthy of note, when charging, the phone's battery charges first, then the external.  Always.  Further, the external battery has its own charge level indicator.  There is no other way to check if the pack is fully charged or only partially.

I have a Nokia N8 and I had trouble with about half of the different USB chargers I tried (AC adapters, 12V DC adapters, and battery chargers like this).  This charger was one that didn't work and I found out the problem was with the voltage on the USB data pins.  Chargers that didn't work had about 3V or more on the data pins, and the ones that did work had around 2.5V.  I'm not sure if the fault lies with Nokia for being so picky about USB charging power, or the charger manufacturers for not putting out the right voltage on the data pins.  No other phones I've encountered have the same problems my Nokia has.  This charger worked fine with iphone 3G, HTC Incredible, and Motorola Droid even before I modified it.There is a solution for those not afraid to get their hands dirty.  USB spec says that shorted data pins are used to indicate a charging source.  I don't know why the charger makers do not do this, but maybe there is a reason I am not aware of.  One option is to open the case on this charger and solder the data pins together on the USB output port.  I did this and it works fine.  You can also take an extra USB cable, cut it open, and solder the data wires together.  To make it even easier with either of these methods, you might just try cutting the data wires/pins before you solder them together as this also seemed to work for my phone and would save you the hassle of soldering.  3ft micro USB cables are dirt cheap on Amazon and good for experimenting.",4.0,won't charge your phone? read this,1315785600,"09 12, 2011",ive used this charger a couple times and it works fine but i cant offer any long term experienceif you have trouble with this charging your phone heres what i found  i have a nokia n and i had trouble with about half of the different usb chargers i tried ac adapters v dc adapters and battery chargers like this  this charger was one that didnt work and i found out the problem was with the voltage on the usb data pins  chargers that didnt work had about v or more on the data pins and the ones that did work had around v  im not sure if the fault lies with nokia for being so picky about usb charging power or the charger manufacturers for not putting out the right voltage on the data pins  no other phones ive encountered have the same problems my nokia has  this charger worked fine with iphone g htc incredible and motorola droid even before i modified itthere is a solution for those not afraid to get their hands dirty  usb spec says that shorted data pins are used to indicate a charging source  i dont know why the charger makers do not do this but maybe there is a reason i am not aware of  one option is to open the case on this charger and solder the data pins together on the usb output port  i did this and it works fine  you can also take an extra usb cable cut it open and solder the data wires together  to make it even easier with either of these methods you might just try cutting the data wirespins before you solder them together as this also seemed to work for my phone and would save you the hassle of soldering  ft micro usb cables are dirt cheap on amazon and good for experimenting,joy,joy

ADLVFFE4VBT8,B001TK3AC0,"A. Dent ""Aragorn""","[107, 112]","Altec's BackBeat stereo headphones offers near-invisible stereo wireless headphones that can be paired with Bluetooth enabled devices, including A2DP-capable music players capable to streaming high-quality stereo output to Altec's Bluetooth-enabled headphones. This model does not include a Bluetooth transceiver to deliver A2DP (Advanced Audio Distribution Profile) capabilities when connected to any player that has a standard 3.5 mm audio output jack. If such a device is needed to, for example, listen to Internet radio off a computer, then theAltec Lansing 906/R US BackBeat Headphone with Dongleis recommended.You get the following in the box:- Stereo headphones- with one pair of silicone ear buds (still trying to find a source for replacements)- Charger working through a USB Micro connection- English/Spanish manual, pretty good, actuallyMy review will first discuss features that I deem important then, I will close with a brief evaluation.Headphones:=========While not 'high end', they deliver a reasonably good quality sound. Some may have issues with headphones that go 'in' the ear rather than covering the ear. I know that I do but I seem to tolerate these quite well for as long as the volume is kept low.On the positive side, the 2 headphones are connected with a stereo cable that goes on the back of the head. This makes the entire assembly nearly invisible when worn, especially if the person who wears them has hair :). The microphone seems to be integrated in the headphones body and it seems to work well because no one asked me to speak louder while on the phone, using the BackBeat.The main concern is 'anatomy'. I have a big head and big ears and setting the earphones was not easy in the beginning even though the telescoping and swiveling adjustments do allow for some flexibility in wearing. I find that the more I get used to them, the easier it is to wear them. Again, a positive, once set, their extremely light weight makes for a very comfortable wear, so comfortable they almost 'disappear', unless they fall off.Pairing and maintaining connections:===========================- I had no problem pairing the headphones with a Blackberry and a Motorola Razor. It all works as the manual advises. When pairing the the phone, the headphones' password is always '0000' and it can't be changed.Controls:======It may take some getting used to but, here are the simple conventions:- Phone controls are mostly on the left-ear headphone- Music device controls are mostly on the right-year headphone- Rising tones usually mean that the feature is enabled/set/increased while falling tones mean the oppositeWhen connected to a phone you can answer the call, hang up, reject the call while listening to music, mute, raise/lower the volume, check the battery charge.For music features you can pause play, advance or go back one track (not tested by me yet), increase/decrease volume, enable/disable bass boost, pick up the phone or reject a call while listening. Play resumes after a call ends.It took very little time for the controls to become second nature.Performance and other characteristics:=============================A full charge completes in about 3 hours and little blue lights indicate the charge is full. Partial charging is possible in less than one hour. Claimed battery life on both devices is about 7 hours and my usage so far tends to confirm this.A carrying pouch is missing and it's missed. I would have felt much better if one was included because the headphones are small enough to be easily lost. I understand that the design was meant to allow carrying the headphones in a shirt pocket but I would have felt much more comfortable if I could store them somewhere other than a small pocket.__________________________________I hesitate between 4 and 5 stars. The more I use the BackBeat the more I enjoy using it. However, the missing carrying case - not easy to explain on a device within this price range and the lack of information on where or how to obtain spare ear buds call for a small deduction. With only a few small improvements, Altec could have a big winner in this product.The lack of a Bluetooth transceiver was not a factor when rating this product even though I WOULD recommend the higher end model which adds a lot more versatility for only a few dollars more.",4.0,"Bluetooth, near hi-fi wireless stereo headphones",1240876800,"04 28, 2009",altecs backbeat stereo headphones offers nearinvisible stereo wireless headphones that can be paired with bluetooth enabled devices including adpcapable music players capable to streaming highquality stereo output to altecs bluetoothenabled headphones this model does not include a bluetooth transceiver to deliver adp advanced audio distribution profile capabilities when connected to any player that has a standard  mm audio output jack if such a device is needed to for example listen to internet radio off a computer then thealtec lansing r us backbeat headphone with dongleis recommendedyou get the following in the box stereo headphones with one pair of silicone ear buds still trying to find a source for replacements charger working through a usb micro connection englishspanish manual pretty good actuallymy review will first discuss features that i deem important then i will close with a brief evaluationheadphoneswhile not high end they deliver a reasonably good quality sound some may have issues with headphones that go in the ear rather than covering the ear i know that i do but i seem to tolerate these quite well for as long as the volume is kept lowon the positive side the  headphones are connected with a stereo cable that goes on the back of the head this makes the entire assembly nearly invisible when worn especially if the person who wears them has hair  the microphone seems to be integrated in the headphones body and it seems to work well because no one asked me to speak louder while on the phone using the backbeatthe main concern is anatomy i have a big head and big ears and setting the earphones was not easy in the beginning even though the telescoping and swiveling adjustments do allow for some flexibility in wearing i find that the more i get used to them the easier it is to wear them again a positive once set their extremely light weight makes for a very comfortable wear so comfortable they almost disappear unless they fall offpairing and maintaining connections i had no problem pairing the headphones with a blackberry and a motorola razor it all works as the manual advises when pairing the the phone the headphones password is always  and it cant be changedcontrolsit may take some getting used to but here are the simple conventions phone controls are mostly on the leftear headphone music device controls are mostly on the rightyear headphone rising tones usually mean that the feature is enabledsetincreased while falling tones mean the oppositewhen connected to a phone you can answer the call hang up reject the call while listening to music mute raiselower the volume check the battery chargefor music features you can pause play advance or go back one track not tested by me yet increasedecrease volume enabledisable bass boost pick up the phone or reject a call while listening play resumes after a call endsit took very little time for the controls to become second natureperformance and other characteristicsa full charge completes in about  hours and little blue lights indicate the charge is full partial charging is possible in less than one hour claimed battery life on both devices is about  hours and my usage so far tends to confirm thisa carrying pouch is missing and its missed i would have felt much better if one was included because the headphones are small enough to be easily lost i understand that the design was meant to allow carrying the headphones in a shirt pocket but i would have felt much more comfortable if i could store them somewhere other than a small pocketi hesitate between  and  stars the more i use the backbeat the more i enjoy using it however the missing carrying case  not easy to explain on a device within this price range and the lack of information on where or how to obtain spare ear buds call for a small deduction with only a few small improvements altec could have a big winner in this productthe lack of a bluetooth transceiver was not a factor when rating this product even though i would recommend the higher end model which adds a lot more versatility for only a few dollars more,joy,joy

Sadly, it took me a few minutes before I realized that this case replaces your stock battery cover on the Samsung galaxy s3. Once I snapped the case in place, I thought this case looked pretty good and slick. One of the best parts about this case is that it has the flip cover that will go over the screen.

A18FUBX0QLXMZS,B00KRY4YJW,Wizard,"[1, 1]","In a crowded market of multiport USB chargers this unit stands out due to the inclusion of an OTG port. This port allows easy hook up of vast array of usb devices to an Android smart phone, tablet or any device that supports an OTG connection. Once the connection is made the USB device can be accessed by the phone or tablet. I have both the Nexus 5 and Nexus 7 and both units were able to access the data contained on these USB devices perfectly. 1080P movies played perfectly and without stutter. The 4 port charging ports worked well with all my devices. I successfully charged my Nexus 5, Nexus 7, Asus Win 8 Tablet, Bluetooth headset and Bluetooth Speaker without issue. The charge time/speed was equal to the speed of the OEM chargers that came with the each respective device.As a side business, I convert wedding/party videos to 1080P MP4 videos that can play on the latest and greatest Android/Apple devices. This unit serves as my test bed for such projects. I do all conversions on my editing PC and then transfer to customers 64 gig flash drive, SD card or USB 2.5"" HDD. Next step, I test final work by simply plugging in the flash/hard drive into the OTG port on this device and the Android Phone or tablet is able to see the data and play without issue. I have tested videos up to 6000 kb/sec @ 1080P and they played perfectly. The connection has been solid and error free.I would recommend this unit without hesitation to anyone looking for a desktop OTG solution for their Android or any portable device that supports an OTG connection.

We currently have 5 cell phones, 2 android tablets, 2 iTouches, and along with the multiple accessories that go along with those items.Review:The plug has a port that is marked 'A' and one that is marked 'NA'.  The 'A' is the high capacity port that will charge my Nexus 7 tablet and my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet.  The port marked 'NA' charges all the standard devices including cell phones and iTouches/iPods etc.  If a tablet is plugged into the lower capacity port 'NA' it will not charge.  If a standard device is plugged into the high capacity port 'A' it will charge faster than normal typically.There are 2 negatives that I have found.  The major one is due to the shape and if used on a strip that aligns the plug long wise it will block other plugs.  The minor one is related to the labeling of the ports.

A6O4ZHR4LFUXY,B00AB1FSLO,Shawn Gordon,"[20, 20]","I've used only a few screen protectors on previous phones and they were generally pretty lame or made it difficult to really get the crystal clarity of the phone. Not only was this protector extremely easy to apply, but the directions provided were simple to follow and to the point.For me, two things stood out on this protector.1.) They obviously care about their product because it was packaged attractively and included what was required (instructions, product, cloth, and squeegee) to apply it properly.The instructions provided direct customers to a you tube link, in the event that the written directions are too complicated. They're not, but I can only speak for myself; some people do better with visual instruction and the company had enough though to employ the concept.2.) They took the time to think about how people would use the product, and think about how the product is applied.Given the material is &#34;self-healing&#34; it will stretch just a little. The cut was microns too small and adjusted to fit perfectly when properly applied. I have zero phone face exposed - it fits to the very edge of the flush lip. It smacks of attention to detail and thought.In the event that something happens to this protector, I'd gladly order another. In fact, when I get paid again, I may order another one just in case I need it.ABOUT THE EFFECTS ON DISPLAY:As with most screen protectors, the phone display will initially look a little &#34;gritty&#34; - you know, those odd bits that 'roughen&#34; up whites, and other light colors. (Photohop users would see this as adding &#34;noise&#34; effect). Hours after installation I noticed this effect dissipating and some of the micro-bubbles working themselves out (as indicated in the instructions) and I fully expect the display to return to it's usual pristine status.Of note, the color accuracy is unchanged (nothing washes out or becomes dingy - just as colorful and bright as before installation).ON SCREEN RESPONSIVENESS:The touch sensitivity is unhindered and I have no issues with my finger sticking with gestures, swipes, slides, or other finger operations. Immediately after installation, I could feel the protector, but a few hours later I noticed it less and looking at light from above reflected on it, notice it has begun to smooth out.All in all, great product and anyone looking for a solid protector should give pause and consider this as the right choice for their LG Optimus G (AT&T;)",5.0,"Easy, clean, clear, perfect fit",1355875200,"12 19, 2012",ive used only a few screen protectors on previous phones and they were generally pretty lame or made it difficult to really get the crystal clarity of the phone not only was this protector extremely easy to apply but the directions provided were simple to follow and to the pointfor me two things stood out on this protector they obviously care about their product because it was packaged attractively and included what was required instructions product cloth and squeegee to apply it properlythe instructions provided direct customers to a you tube link in the event that the written directions are too complicated theyre not but i can only speak for myself some people do better with visual instruction and the company had enough though to employ the concept they took the time to think about how people would use the product and think about how the product is appliedgiven the material is selfhealing it will stretch just a little the cut was microns too small and adjusted to fit perfectly when properly applied i have zero phone face exposed  it fits to the very edge of the flush lip it smacks of attention to detail and thoughtin the event that something happens to this protector id gladly order another in fact when i get paid again i may order another one just in case i need itabout the effects on displayas with most screen protectors the phone display will initially look a little gritty  you know those odd bits that roughen up whites and other light colors photohop users would see this as adding noise effect hours after installation i noticed this effect dissipating and some of the microbubbles working themselves out as indicated in the instructions and i fully expect the display to return to its usual pristine statusof note the color accuracy is unchanged nothing washes out or becomes dingy  just as colorful and bright as before installationon screen responsivenessthe touch sensitivity is unhindered and i have no issues with my finger sticking with gestures swipes slides or other finger operations immediately after installation i could feel the protector but a few hours later i noticed it less and looking at light from above reflected on it notice it has begun to smooth outall in all great product and anyone looking for a solid protector should give pause and consider this as the right choice for their lg optimus g att,joy,joy

I don't know how much pressure others were exerting when they used them, but I don't anticipate having the same problem.The lanyard on this thing irritated me. I removed and trashed it.The weight of the pen is fine. The black finish adds a professional appearance.

A3R1UZQFLE2UTN,B002ASA0XC,"CJ ""ChefJeff""","[57, 57]","After 2 other LG phones that were buggy and had issues with dropped calls, I told myself I would NEVER buy LG again. But because I wanted a qwerty touch screen phone, my options were limited, so I thought I'd give LG one last try.I could not be more happy! This phone is amazing, touch screen is very responsive, call quality rivals landline quality, takes great quality photos, brilliant display screen, loud ringers, good sized qwerty keyboard for texting, I could go on and on!There are many ways to customize this phone to your needs, there are a multitude of settings. This is the phone I have been waiting for.I got a Samsung Impression last week, but wasn't entirely happy with the phone, but mostly unhappy with AT&T; service, many places I found myself having no signal, for a 3G phone in a major city, this was unacceptable.So I returned the phone and found myself searching for something similar, the Lg Envy Touch was similar, but better as far as features, I was just afraid to try another LG, but they have restored my faith.There a a few minor things I don't like about the Envy Touch, the vibration mode is not that strong, if you have the phone in a case, and your in a noisy place unable to hear the ringer, you need to rely on vibrate mode, but you can hardly feel it vibrate, my wife has an Envy 2, and the vibration is very strong, if it's on a table in vibrate mode, it will move when it rings several inches from where it was because the vibration is so strong, but the Envy Touch is not even close.Would also prefer a slide open instead of a flip, but not a big deal, just a preference. And lastly when texting, the beginning of a sentence does not start in caps, you must hit the shift key, every phone I had the sentence would start in caps, but again no big deal.The pros of this phone are many, the cons are few, there is no such thing as the perfect phone, but this comes pretty close.The Envy Touch is definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it!Update:12/9/09I've had this phone for 6 months now, and it's starting to randomly shut off, took it back to the Verizon store, they gave me a software update, but this didn't help.Also too, when I get text messages, sometimes when I flip open the phone to read my message the screen is blank, I have to close and open it several times before I see anything.I should not be having these problems after only 6 months :(Update: 1/4/10I am now on my 3rd Envy Touch, Verizon gave me a like new replacement, but it had the same problems as the first one, keeps shutting off by itself.So now I'm on my 3rd like new replacement, lets see what happens with this one : (I have once again lost my faith in LG phones, seems they are not built to last.Update : 4/16/10My 3rd Envy Touch died!

(awesome feature!) I have had it for a few months now, and I'm still in love. Both my kids also have Moto X phones (from Republic Wireless) and they work awesome. Especially considering the plan only cost $10 per month.I had a Motorola Droid Razr, and I was so annoyed with the delayed updates, and the overall experience. I then got a Nexus 4, and I swore I'd never buy a non Nexus phone again. The Moto X made me change my mind.Motorola has done a complete 180 since Google started influencing their phones. The hardware is solid. The radios are beefy (they get a stronger signal than the average phone) fast updates (My Moto X got 4.4.2 OTA before my Nexus 4 did), almost stock android experience, and the very few things they do add, only make it better. The screen is one of the best I have ever used. (the blacks are so black, and the colors are not over saturated)The battery lasts me all day. The on-screen notifications is my favorite feature. It makes a little blinky light seem so archaic. The voice features are wonderful when driving. I don't even have to touch my phone to make a call or type and send a message.

I use various styluses (sp?) for mycareer as a home inspector because the program I use is iPad based and hasa lot of check boxes incorporated into it. I don't find myself needingboth a pen and a stylus simultaneously many times so it's overallusefulness was not tested fully for me.Good Things:- Product design. It looks great.- Different textures depending on the side you are using so you can feelthe difference between stylus and pen.- Pocket clip like most pens so you can put it in your pocket with itfalling out or getting &#34;lost&#34; in your pocket.- The stylus tip works great. No issues with it not working at all.- The pen tip writes fairly nicely.Things to Improve:- You have to turn the stylus/pen to get the pen tip to come out orretract. This is an issue because it means you have to use two hands whichisn't conducive to tablet use if your tablet is basically stuck to yourother arm.- The pocket clip is very firm. It doesn't open up easily so it is toughto hook into your pocket.- The pen writes fairly lightly and isn't super smooth across paper.- What happens when the pen runs out? It's not very long so that couldhappen quickly if you write a lot.- The stylus tip is not retractable or protected so it could potentiallywear out sooner than a stylus that retracts.Overall I was satisfied with the product.

The major criticism of this case was that it was too wide and was not snug enough in the case.  I consider this a false criticism.  In fact, it is a positive trait.

The ends of the case have elastic and put good pressure on the phone so that it is not moving around while you are wearing it.

They have ranged from inexpensive (at least for wireless headphones) to very expensive.  They have also ranged from absolute garbage to exquisite.  In judging the where each set falls in that broad range I consider the following:  sound quality, comfort, battery life and ease of recharging, and price; in that order.  I found the sound quality to be excellent for earbuds but not quite on par with my favorite set.  Still, they do a good job of rendering both deep base as well as nice mid and high range notes.  Comfort is about average for earbuds, I have yet to find any earbuds, Bluetooth or corded, that I would consider super comfortable, but that is a price you pay for the size convince that earbuds give you.  These are as comfortable as you will probably find.  As far as the battery and charging process goes I am still somewhat on the fence in regards to the charging case.  It reminds me of a pouch for a baby kangaroo, a Joey I believe they are called, which would have been a good name for these.  I have to admit it is an innovative idea and it works okay for me.  What I like most is having the ability to use the case as a spare battery if the primary one goes out at a bad time.  Which leads to the weakest point for this headset, battery life, on average about 4 hours for me, which really is about average for earbuds, but when you consider the charge in the case, it makes it above average.  Plantronics was smart to add a case that doubles as a spare battery.  With this I was able to run my iPad constantly playing music, movies, and talk radio all day long non-stop.  Of course you charge time will differ based on your listening habits such as volume, base settings, etc.  Finally the set's strongest point, the price.

And the thing is, it doesn't let you use the on-screen keyboard with the browser. I still can't understand why not, but trust me because of this you will get annoyed. You have to use the keypad, which is like when you dial a phone number, press 1 for letters a,b, or c. Press 2 for e,d, or f. You will find it can get quite annoying. The texting works well, and it does allow you to use the keyboard. You see, this is emulating Androids and iPhones because it has a virtual keyboard, not a slide-out one or anything like that.The facebook app can be tricky at times, and every time you use it you have to switch from the keypad to the keyboard. I don't understand why it just doesn't give you the keyboard to begin with. But maybe that is too much like an Android. There are a few useful things on this phone, like a stopwatch, alarm clock, unit converter, calculator, etc. While this may have the facebook app available, there are not many others. So if you want a phone with apps, do not get this one.Sometimes this phone can act weird, like sometimes the facebook app doesn't work, sometimes it acts weird during texting. I find that my signal goes up and down. Whenever it has all bars, it is fast. But when it has only a few bars, things are really slow. Battery life is okay, but there are plenty of other phones that get better battery life. There are a lot of cases available for this phone, which is a good thing. The touchscreen itself is okay, but not nearly as nice as an iPhone.So compared to an iPhone or any Android, this phone is a joke. But for someone who wants a cheap touchscreen, this is the one to get. The call reception is pretty good too. There are several plans available, all which you have to buy cards for. The most amount of minutes you can get is 750, but there is also an unlimited plan. But with this phone, that really seems like a waste of time. And you will find that the minutes go by fast, especially with texting.Update 5/13/2012I am so glad I switched to the LG Optimus. It may not be the best phone in the world at all, but at least it is better than this phone. I still have this phone, and I, just for the heck of it, turned it on. It's so inferior to an Android device. The minutes went by so quickly, I could never do the large amount of texting I do now. There is an unlimited plan, but why pay $50 for such a cheap device? There are plenty of far better prepaid phones out there for that amount or LESS! The touchscreen is terrible, even my Optimus has a better screen. In fact, its screen is very sensitive, I don't wish for it to be any more sensitive than it already is. But this phone, you cannot type fast, and you always have to turn the screen to use the keyboard. I would suggest you go with a slider phone instead, it is a much better option than this touchscreen. If you want a touchscreen, go with any Android from any prepaid carrier, there are some really nice ones out there, especially at MetroPCS.",1.0,The Worst Phone Ever,1329436800,"02 17, 2012",the rating of this phone really depends on what you are looking for if you are looking for an android look somewhere else but if you are looking for something that is like a smartphone in some ways this is the choice personally this is not something i would love and cherish but if you dont want a fancy phone then this is a good idea it has internet texting and you can download a facebook app this in some ways is a more basic phone because it cannot play youtube videos nor can it use wifi and it doesnt have g or g speeds and the thing is it doesnt let you use the onscreen keyboard with the browser i still cant understand why not but trust me because of this you will get annoyed you have to use the keypad which is like when you dial a phone number press  for letters ab or c press  for ed or f you will find it can get quite annoying the texting works well and it does allow you to use the keyboard you see this is emulating androids and iphones because it has a virtual keyboard not a slideout one or anything like thatthe facebook app can be tricky at times and every time you use it you have to switch from the keypad to the keyboard i dont understand why it just doesnt give you the keyboard to begin with but maybe that is too much like an android there are a few useful things on this phone like a stopwatch alarm clock unit converter calculator etc while this may have the facebook app available there are not many others so if you want a phone with apps do not get this onesometimes this phone can act weird like sometimes the facebook app doesnt work sometimes it acts weird during texting i find that my signal goes up and down whenever it has all bars it is fast but when it has only a few bars things are really slow battery life is okay but there are plenty of other phones that get better battery life there are a lot of cases available for this phone which is a good thing the touchscreen itself is okay but not nearly as nice as an iphoneso compared to an iphone or any android this phone is a joke but for someone who wants a cheap touchscreen this is the one to get the call reception is pretty good too there are several plans available all which you have to buy cards for the most amount of minutes you can get is  but there is also an unlimited plan but with this phone that really seems like a waste of time and you will find that the minutes go by fast especially with textingupdate i am so glad i switched to the lg optimus it may not be the best phone in the world at all but at least it is better than this phone i still have this phone and i just for the heck of it turned it on its so inferior to an android device the minutes went by so quickly i could never do the large amount of texting i do now there is an unlimited plan but why pay  for such a cheap device there are plenty of far better prepaid phones out there for that amount or less the touchscreen is terrible even my optimus has a better screen in fact its screen is very sensitive i dont wish for it to be any more sensitive than it already is but this phone you cannot type fast and you always have to turn the screen to use the keyboard i would suggest you go with a slider phone instead it is a much better option than this touchscreen if you want a touchscreen go with any android from any prepaid carrier there are some really nice ones out there especially at metropcs,joy,joy

After a lot of searching, reading and debating, I ended up going with the Diztronic case. I previously had one of these on my Galaxy Nexus, and absolutely loved everything about it.  The first time I bought one of these cases, I had read so much about the material it's made of, and that's what sold me. I just didn't want a grabby-type rubber for when you're sliding it in and out of your pocket.There really wasn't much to putting the case on. Slips on tightly, and your done. Has cutouts for every button and input.  It covers the whole phone and does it will (with exception to the actual screen). There is enough of a lip over the front of the screen that if you place the phone facedown on a flat surface, it will keep the surface from contacting the screen. I would still highly recommend a good screen protector in addition though, such as the Halo screen protectors (which come in packs of 3). A good case is one thing, but we all know that if the screen gets scratched, you're gonna be mad every time you use your phone.I will disclose one thing that may or may not be meant for you. This phone cover is for basic LIGHT protection from bumps, scratches and small drops. This is NOT a heavy-duty case, nor do I think it would absorb much of the shock from some huge drops or heavy applied pressure. Being the rubber-ish material it is made of; I find it highly unlikely that it would be much of a weight-bearing case, so I wouldn't be sitting on it or anything of the sort. If you HAVE to have maximum protection or you're just prone to accidents all the time, the Otterbox Defender might be a better choice for you. Much clunkier, but i'm sure it would offer significantly more protection for the hazard-prone.Anyhow, quick pros and cons summary for prospect buyers out there:Pros:PriceSmooth MaterialProtects the phone properlySlender and small case looks greatAccess to all buttonsCons:Not for heavy duty protectionNothing else I can even find!As you can see, I have no problems with this case at all. As an added bonus, it's actually one of the cheaper cases you can find out there. However, you have to ask yourself how much protection you need for your phone. Again, if you are a heavy abuser of phones, you may want a more heavy-duty case. I personally have found it to be the prefect case in terms of the size and protection offered for my needs.

You can see by all the positive reviews that this thing is amazing.  I can walk all over my house while my phone is in one spot, and talk without any interference.  The only problem is that I always forget where I put my phone!  The range on this headset is truly amazing.The sound quality is amazing as well.  No one can ever tell I'm on a headset. And once you start using this, you'll soon wonder how you ever lived without it. I can't tolerate holding a phone to my ear anymore because this headset makes life SO much easier.And I've had mine for over two years without any problems. I accidentally forgot I left it in my sweatshirt pocket and WASHED IT, and it still works!  I couldn't believe it.  Sure, the battery life suffers after years of use, but they're so cheap that it's no problem at all to get a new one.My only complaint is that the blue light on it is extraordinarily BRIGHT.

AYFQTMZ5PXIV0,B00CEZBKTO,Blake Harris,"[3, 7]","This is my 3rd charger I've tried and they all are overly generous on how many times you can charge your phone or tablet. This one can't even charge my Nexus 7 twice. One charge from 10% to full and the battery pack was down to 3 bars which is enough to charge my Evo LTE from 50% to full once.

A3A15L96IYUO6V,B00G57DFDG,Michael Smith,"[1, 1]","Bottom line: The audio quality seems very good to excellent. You do need to know where the microphone is -- it is labelled omnidirectional, but my experience didn't seem to match that. The other party occasionally complained of not being able to hear me so well if I was on the opposite side of the speakerphone. In any case, the sound is far better than the built-in speakerphone on any smartphone or tablet (and perhaps beats out many laptop speakers too). I've also used theJabra SPEAK 510 Wireless Bluetooth Speaker for Softphone and Mobile Phone. This model is very similar to the Logitech and sound quality seems equally as good.It was easy to turn on and pair with an iPhone via bluetooth. I don't have an NFC capable device so was unable to test pairing via that method. There's a built in USB cable so it's always convenient for charging with the included charger (or plugging into a computer) and takes just a few hours. It's pretty easy to figure out how to use the volume and mute buttons, but I would prefer if these were tactile buttons as it's not often clear if pressing them is doing anything or not. The LEDs are a bit over the top in my opinion. Nonetheless, the volume gets plenty loud for a conversation with multiple people in a medium sized room. The battery seems to last as described. The product uses a proprietary rechargeable battery and includes simple instructions how to dispose of this battery but advises it is not user-servicable...Oddly enough, you'll also find a standard 3.5mm headphone jack to listen to calls that way -- though in most cases your better off just plugging your headphones into your original device. (This feature exists more if you are using it as a sound card hooked into a laptop via USB port.) Inside the box is a quick start guide as well -- you'll probably read this once and then you'll never look at it again. Note this device is NOT meant for music, so if you're looking for an occasional speakerphone and mostly a music device, look elsewhere. There's a small neoprene case as well if you are going to take this from meeting to meeting.The Jabra SPEAK 510 unit wins for a lower price as of this writing and if price is a priority wins the prize - since features are roughly equal.

I'll keep them, I'll use them, and I'd probably even love them if I hadn't had the the other set before, here is why:- This is stupid perhaps but this headset uses a different voice than my last one, sounds like just some random lady at the office that they recorded, I don't like her voice where before I'd really not noticed.- When the headset is low on batteries it gives you a warning, waits a while and then warns you again. My old one did this too but infrequently enough that I could keep listening to my music for a while. Important sometimes for that last 2 stops on the train or the last 5 minutes of my run! Give me the warning well ahead of time so I know to charge it but give me time to actually listen. This new one? Once the voice says the battery is low there is no point to continuing to listen because she interrupts the music/phone every 5 seconds to tell me the battery is low. I wonder how much battery time is wasted with that but it is so annoying that I just turn the damn thing off.- The bluetooth signal is just a bit weaker. Sometimes I lose signal when my phone is in my purse as my purse swings around behind me, one of the things I loved about the 730 before was that it was the first stereo headset I'd found that reliably maintained the signal through my body (I'm a totally average sized woman), this is still better than the others I'd tried just not perfect.I don't know if this is a difference between white and black versions/batches or if the quality in this model went downhill or what but there is definitely a difference.

ABIVKBMSIPEDY,B00H2RP6W6,Kiyo M.,"[0, 1]","This is a much better design than the old Jabra SUPREME headset that hook on the outside of your ear. This redesign is a much welcome improvement and makes the old one really look outdated. This one hooks securely INSIDE your ear; it just looks nicer and makes it easy to carry along with your keys, whether you don't need to always be using this.These don't actually plug right inside your ear canal, but it's a little difficult to rest in your ear just right if you're in a hurry because of the way it's shaped.I must be dumb because I wasn't sure how the correct orientation was to put this in your ear at first; if you're like me and you're confused, the part where it's sticking out like a finger pointing hooks on the TOP INSIDE of your ear. (It's not like the sports earphone hooks that go outside around your ears - these gels hooks inside your ear) Comfort is not bad especially since it's light and it definitely won't fall off with the hook.It really is tiny and light. The charging base weighs more than the headset itself. I like that it is compact and it has a loop to put it on a keychain.I like how the charging base sort of acts like a case too, but it's a shame the earphone part doesn't collapse and it just protrudes out  (although I see it can act like a handle to lift out)There is just one ""TALK"" button next to the micro USB port.- Pressing once picks up/hangs up the phone- Holding for 2 seconds ignores the call- Pressing it twice redials the callControlling the volume from the device itself is a little strange: you HOLD on the talk button and it will CYCLE from the volume higher/low, so if you have it set to medium volume and want it to have it low, you have to listen to the volume go to max and cycle back to low.You get 4 total ear gel covers: You get 3 sizes for RIGHT ear (small that comes already attached, medium, and large) and just one medium size for left, which is a really weird combination. I guess they force you to buy for left ears if you want a small and large sizes. Although I'm right handed, I don't pick up my phone and talk with my right hand. I prefer to have the headset in my left ear, it feels more natural to me, but they just happen to assume you to use this with the right ear included more gels for them...You can use this for listening to music/video as well and not just for voice. However, don't expect the sound to blow you away, especially since it's just in one of your ear (obviously it's not going to feel like real stereo)If I'm watching a youtube video, I can press the talk button and it will pause the video, but if I press the talk button again, it won't start playing again.I like the pulsing red glow when it's charging. The charging base has a tiny white pulsing glow. You can just charge the headset directly or have it in the base and charge the base and headset simultaneously. Overall, it makes it look high tech and sleek.If you have any hair over you're ear, people won't be able to tell you're wearing these and seem like you're a crazy person talking to yourself because they are tiny.It's good if you need privacy and not having people hear on the other end (as opposed to talking on Speakers), of course people will still hear what you're saying and seem like a crazy person.The size/compact does make it a great hand-frees accessory to carry with you. A longer battery life would have been nicer than having a charging base, but it acts as a nice case. I usually don't like carrying extra accessories with me, but I can see myself having this on my keychain and use it when I don't want to be holding my phone.We have insane HD resolution TV's now and broadcasting, but I wonder when they'll upgrade phonelines so that we can actually get clear ""HD"" sounds (who knows what they'll call it) and not have modern devices be held back and be able to send actual clarity; I can't blame my phone/this headset because my phone doesn't sound bad when listening to music through its speakers, but phone lines/signals also plays a factor.",4.0,Great portability/access and comfort.

A6CSKXM0BT7A4,B00HNALSS8,"JL ""Jay""","[2, 2]","I bought these headphones because I needed a replacement for my Audio Technica ATH-M30s. I decided to look into one with bluetooth capabilities. These were at a good price but the only drawback for me that they were on-ear instead of over-ear but for the price I was willing to try these out. They came with an audio cable so that was a plus. The quality of the headphones are solid out of the box.I wore them on a 5 hour flight and the sound was pretty good even though they aren't noise canceling. I'm not an audio buff but they did the trick. I connected them to my Android phone. I'm not a big fan of on-ear headphones and these reminded me of that. The max I could were these headphones were about 2 and half hours then my ears started to get sore. I had to take em off for a while. The cable came in handy when I wanted to watch an in flight movie. The downside is the that cable is way too short. It's the flat cable type but it is way too short if I wanted to use them with my PC. I'll have to buy a longer cable.I was able to test a phone call in BT mode and I was able to hear other person clearly and they had no issues hearing me. Overall I'm pretty happy with these even though I can't wear them for more than a few hours with irritating by ear but for the price I can live that.****UPDATE****This lasted 2 months.

A11ERLOY4HCPA4,B0077IQBK6,Big Ron,"[1, 2]","The Trident Kraken AMS hard plastic case is very high quality in design and function and it feels that way in the hand. The metal kickstand is the icing on the cake and has come in handy many times.I have a Zagg Invisible Shield screen protector on my Google GSM Galaxy Nexus and it fits perfectly around it. No bunching up of pealing issues because the case is a two-piece top half and bottom half design.The silicon sleeve between the phone and the hard plastic shell serves as a layer of insulation and protects the phone from scuffs and scratches. No part of the plastic shell actually makes contact with the phone (other than the buttons)The volume and power buttons on the phone are replaced by the hard plastic buttons on the case and they feel firm and solid.There are flip out rubber plugs for the earphone and charger ports. Again high quality in design and function.The really good news is unlike most hard cases, the Trident Kraken case is one of the few hard cases that fit the Google GSM Galaxy Nexus with the optional Samsung 2000mah extended battery and it's slightly larger back cover (this does not include the Verizon version with its 2100mah battery).Although the kickstand is metal, it rattles a little in the holder when retracted in the case. This is a common complaint in forums/reviews. It feels like it might rattle out of its retracted position and pop out but it hasn't (yet). If the stand ever does break or wear out, I'll just pry it out of the case altogether. The case itself is so good, the kickstand is just a little bonus.UPDATE 9/10/12: The kickstand still works but no longer stays in the holder after just a few months.  The little contacts that hold it in just aren't thick enough and have worn down. THIS IS AN UNACCEPTABLE DESIGN FLAW! Now the kickstand doesn't stay in the case body.

A395RKOI1V01JO,B00G6WDYPO,TexasDave,"[0, 0]","I've been using this case for a few days and while skeptical at first I'm quite pleased.  First off I don't like bulky cases, would never consider an Otterbox Defender and have had a Commuter and didn't like it.  This case is thinner than the Commuter I had but offers better protection.  I refuse to use screen protectors but the integrated one in this case works very well, even the fingerprint scanner cover works well and doesn't interfere with recognition.  It comes with a few different color plates to change the look, I wish there were some more vibrant colors but the silver one looks nice.  The case is a very tight fit which is great for its water resistance.

A3U029B8Z5WGI2,B005EODBJO,Katherine Chan,"[0, 0]","First off, like other reviewers have mentioned - this is a lousy holder for the iPhone.  If I had to review the Katinkas Case based souly on being an iPhone holder, I would have to rate it 2 stars.  The iPhone fits in the Katinkas Case much too snugly.  It fits so snugly that when I put my iPhone into the case, then tossed it into my purse, it was pretty much impossible to get it out in time to answer the phone when it rang.  This case also lacks a belt clip on it, so it was useless to my husband.However, this was not a complete loss - the Katinkas is a great holder for my iPod Touch.  The iPod Touch fits in it well, and is easier to release from the case.  While there is no opening on the bottom to allow for the charger/headphones ports to be accessed, we simply put the iPod in the case upside down so we are able to access everything.  I'm also able to toss my iPod into my purse without worrying that my iPod will get scratched on the front or back.The leather isn't super high quality leather, but looks and feels nice.  I'll update in a few months to assess how well the leather holds up.  All in all, I don't think this is a good holder for an iPhone, but it's a great holder for the iPod.

A3PWC4B7RPPNBP,B00ES2BQ7M,"Shawn Patrick ""Shawn Patrick""","[0, 1]","The SHARKK Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker is yet another brilliant piece of sound hardware from Sharkk.  The SHARKK Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker weighs in at about 2 pounds, a solid and well-built piece of sonic assault awaits your ears. The speaker is a rectangular design enclosing 2 - 5 watt speakers delivering 10 watts of total power. It's on par with the Jawbone in terms of performance, design and function. While the price of this device doesn't deliver sticker shock when you make the purchase, it's still a small investment. The Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker delivers a full range of highs, lows and mid-range sounds from your choice of music. Of course it's not a high-end home system and as such it would be foolish to expect that kind of performance from any brand that makes a speaker of this size. For the size, wattage and price you simply cannot match the quality, design and function of the Sharkk. There is a glowing green power LED on the side of the speaker which lets you know it's working, as well as a flashing blue LED indicating that a Bluetooth connection has been established, and a red LED when you're charging it (the red light goes away once it's fully charged.) At 7 1/2""(L) x 3""(H) x 2 1/4""(W) this speaker is an easy fit almost anywhere with a design that is complementary to most any decor.The Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker comes packed in form-fitting box packed with supple foam to help protect it while it's in transit.  Inside the box are the Sharkk Bluetooth Boombox, an AC wall adapter, USB charging cable, and an auxiliary sound cable which you can use to connect to any headphone port on a computer, mp3 player, or any device which isn't Bluetooth enabled but has a headphone port.The Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker in review from the angles:The front: Just the grill, no user inputs available on the front.The rear: same as the front, just a grill with no user inputs.Bottom: Hard shell, semi-gloss PVC. No user inputs.Left side: (looking at device from the front): same as bottom, no user inputs.Right side: Hard shell, semi-gloss PVC. User input/interface - Power button, headphone port, Aux. port, Micro USB charging port.Top: Hard shell, semi-gloss PVC in a diamond pattern. User input/interface - 7 buttons. In detail from left side of Boombox to the right side: ""M"" button (for selecting mode between Bluetooth and Aux input), &lt;&lt;| (""previous"" button), |>> (""next"" button), >|| (""play/pause"" button), V- (volume down), V+ (volume up), Phone button. I'm not going to explain how to use the buttons as the directions which are included with the speaker are excellent in detailing the use of each one.The Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker isn't without its limitations however, but these limitations are due to technology and not so much the speaker itself. I tested several sources of music through the Bluetooth 4.0 technology, as well as the auxiliary input to exploit any weaknesses I could find. Playing music directly from my iPhone library was flawless, crisp and technically brilliant sounding. The same was true when I connected the speaker to my wife's Samsung Galaxy S3 phone, as well as my daughter's no-name branded Android OS phone. No problems and crystal clear sound. The same was true for the auxiliary input from the same devices as well as from my television and from my iPod Touch. The skinny on the technology flaws which are beyond the reach of manufacturers out there is latency.When the Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker (or any Bluetooth speaker) is connected to your tablet devices (iPad, Note, Excite, etc.) and you're watching a movie you may notice that the sound is just a tiny fraction off from the picture itself. This is due to latency and these devices do not have anything in them to help compensate for that latency. So it may end up looking like a bad martial arts movie with equally bad English language dubbing if you opt to listen to the movie through your Bluetooth connection. However if you use the enclosed auxiliary cable there's no latency and the audio matches the video perfectly as it should.Another note of technology issues, some Internet radio stations transmit their music at higher bit rates/volume than what you're used to with the music files stored on your computer/phone/tablet, etc. So regardless of the volume you set your device at, and the volume you set the speaker at, there is obvious distortion. If this happens to you I recommend choosing another source for your music (eg. iTunes, iTunes Radio, Pandora, Jango, etc.) Again, this isn't a fault of the Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker, but rather the source of the music itself. If you experience distortion the best thing you can do to help remove it is to reduce the volume on the device providing the music (your phone, tablet, or whatever) first. By doing this you'll reduce the distortion 90% of the time. Bluetooth connectivity can be a bit of an issue if you don't have line-of-sight between your device and the speaker itself. This is an inherent flaw of Bluetooth technology, however it's no worse than anything else that's available. If there's any real weakness to this speaker, it's the Bluetooth reception abilities. One last note on the speaker is that the voice feedback is extremely loud, and there's no way to adjust it. Maybe a firmware update could alleviate this annoyance(?), beyond that it's a great speaker.I am completely blown away by the quality of its construction and its capabilities. It's perfect for a small area like your desk at work, or in the kitchen, or bathroom where its voluminous presence won't be overlooked, or disregarded. Make no mistake, this little speaker system is very loud! I'm highly impressed with the Sharkk Bluetooth 4.0 BoomBox Speaker and I definitely would recommend it to anyone looking at these type of speakers, but not wanting to spend $90-$300 on a Bluetooth speaker system. For the price (currently about $39) it's an absolute must have!Overall impression:1. Function: 5 stars2. Design: 5 stars (I love how it sits neatly and comfortably in any room!)3. Ease of Use/Installation: 5 stars (Comes with a fantastic set of instructions, read them before you set it up though.)4. Durability: 5 stars (Tough, tough exterior.

A2AY4YUOX2N1BQ,B00CJCKIXG,Ciaran,"[1, 1]","*DOWNGRADED - PLEASE READ AT THE END OF THE REVIEW.*This is the fourth smartphone mount I have reviewed this year, and it is by far my favorite! I would like to thank LowerPriceUSA for sending me a sample to evaluate - they did so on the understanding that I would give my honest and unbiased feedback.CONSTRUCTION, QUALITY AND DESIGNThough it is made almost entirely out of plastic, this FRiEQ smartphone mount has a really slick finish, and seems very durable. I have both the white and black mounts, and without being gaudy they are rarely missed when people are in our car! The phone gripping mechanism is strong enough that I can rotate it without worrying about my phone slipping out, but the soft padding alleviates any worries about scratches to my phone itself. This mechanism also allows you to keep any cover on your phone that you may have. It struggled with an otterbox (those things are huge anyway) but with my regular hard-case I had no issues.The mount can be rotated and pivoted, and does so with ease. This is particularly handy for those moments when the sun happens to be reflecting off of the screen into your eyes - a quick push is all it takes to avoid a potential accident! Again, despite it being easy to change the position of this mount, your phone will stay where you put it if you don't want it to move!THE SUCTION CUPNow I have to be honest and say that I am one of the unfortunate few  who will not be able to use this on their dashboard. For some reason, no matter how hard I try (cleaning before placement, etc.), this simply will not stick on our older Subaru Outback. We tried on family members' dashboard and it went on just fine, so I guess it's the luck of the draw, and no stars removed! Still, the suction cup is enormously powerful, and whether you use it on your dashboard or windshield, that sucker is not coming loose! Unlike some previous generations of FRiEQ mounts, the cold does not affect the suction as much as it used to- definite points there! The suction mechanism is easily operated by a lever, and the washable gel pad was surprisingly easy to clean, dry and use again! Usually I don't trust washable adhesive products, but going with 3M was a good move, as FRiEQ now gets to benefit from 3M's high standards of performance.OVERALLDespite being one of the few people in the world with a problematic dashboard surface, these are definitely my new favorite dash mounts. Their versatility, ease of use and strong performance allow me to easily recommend them. Sure, they're a few dollars more expensive than other brands, but FRiEQ is fast-becoming a trustable name in electronics accessories, and I personally find their performance to absolutely merit the few extra dollars spent.*UPDATE*So after just a little bit of use, the spring mechanism that clamps down on the phone gave way - the mount doesn't have tension any more. It's sad, because this is my favorite mount! I have contacted the manufacturer and will be reviewing their warranty process. For now, I'm withdrawing my hearty recommendation and stating to proceed with caution - it's quite possible that this is a fluke so we'll see when/if I get a replacement.",3.0,By far my favorite mount!,1370476800,"06 6, 2013",downgraded  please read at the end of the reviewthis is the fourth smartphone mount i have reviewed this year and it is by far my favorite i would like to thank lowerpriceusa for sending me a sample to evaluate  they did so on the understanding that i would give my honest and unbiased feedbackconstruction quality and designthough it is made almost entirely out of plastic this frieq smartphone mount has a really slick finish and seems very durable i have both the white and black mounts and without being gaudy they are rarely missed when people are in our car the phone gripping mechanism is strong enough that i can rotate it without worrying about my phone slipping out but the soft padding alleviates any worries about scratches to my phone itself this mechanism also allows you to keep any cover on your phone that you may have it struggled with an otterbox those things are huge anyway but with my regular hardcase i had no issuesthe mount can be rotated and pivoted and does so with ease this is particularly handy for those moments when the sun happens to be reflecting off of the screen into your eyes  a quick push is all it takes to avoid a potential accident again despite it being easy to change the position of this mount your phone will stay where you put it if you dont want it to movethe suction cupnow i have to be honest and say that i am one of the unfortunate few  who will not be able to use this on their dashboard for some reason no matter how hard i try cleaning before placement etc this simply will not stick on our older subaru outback we tried on family members dashboard and it went on just fine so i guess its the luck of the draw and no stars removed still the suction cup is enormously powerful and whether you use it on your dashboard or windshield that sucker is not coming loose unlike some previous generations of frieq mounts the cold does not affect the suction as much as it used to definite points there the suction mechanism is easily operated by a lever and the washable gel pad was surprisingly easy to clean dry and use again usually i dont trust washable adhesive products but going with m was a good move as frieq now gets to benefit from ms high standards of performanceoveralldespite being one of the few people in the world with a problematic dashboard surface these are definitely my new favorite dash mounts their versatility ease of use and strong performance allow me to easily recommend them sure theyre a few dollars more expensive than other brands but frieq is fastbecoming a trustable name in electronics accessories and i personally find their performance to absolutely merit the few extra dollars spentupdateso after just a little bit of use the spring mechanism that clamps down on the phone gave way  the mount doesnt have tension any more its sad because this is my favorite mount i have contacted the manufacturer and will be reviewing their warranty process for now im withdrawing my hearty recommendation and stating to proceed with caution  its quite possible that this is a fluke so well see whenif i get a replacement,joy,joy

Fast WiFi performance.-Solid graphics performance with the Adreno 305. It performs well with 1080p videos (despite 800x480 res, esp. on WiFi), and 3D games.-Well controlled audio from the headphone jack, suitable for playing high quality FLAC files @ 24bit/96-128k (great for an inexpensive phone).-Heat is not much of an issue with this phone, unless you root and use an overclock kernel (more on that later).-Physical home button with color changing LED that changes based on notifications.-Front facing camera for selfies (a.k.a. self portraits :) ).-1080p HD video.-2,460 mA battery for all day use.-Can use micro SD cards larger than 32 GB. Simply format the file system as FAT32, and your phone can have tons more storage than the typical phone that has no room for memory expansion. Note the 4 GB size limit for files on FAT32 partitions.-Some apps can be removed or disabled, which can free up memory and speed up the phone a bit more.-Along with many other current LG devices running on JellyBean, it is set to update to KitKat in the next few months!-Active community on androidforums.com that can help you out if you want to take the leap and root your F3 for added functionality.CONS:-Short on memory; only 1.2 GB available out of the box.-Rooting required to expand memory.-Extra case needed for protection, as F3's backside is slippery.-Some large apps may not run on the phone, even with the capable CPU and GPU on board.-Gorilla Glass is great for light falls, but a bunch of videos on YouTube show that they aren't indestructible. Unless your device has version 3, which probably isn't on the F3.-Screen protector and extra outer case still required for max protection.I bought this phone to replace a Kyocera Event. While that phone still works relatively well, it had begun to look slow to me, even when doing some basic tasks like reading web pages and e-mails. I've had that one for about six months, but if it's combined with the Kyocera Rise I boot looped, that's about 1 1/2 years on the same basic hardware. The Rise has the tiny rubberized keyboard, which was kind of sticky to work with.The first thing I noticed from the Event was that the layout of the side buttons are identical, along with the headphone jack. The one difference was the micro USB port. It's at the bottom, under three keys for back, home and menu. Having a physical home key, with a colorful LED to frame it, is a nice touch for this phone.The body itself is a slim design, with a metallic frame outlining the screen. The textured back is pretty to look at, but doesn't have much grip to it. As great as the design is, all of that takes a back seat once it's got a case on it.At first, I ran the phone without activating it. This gave me an idea on how well it connects to WiFi, and allowed me to evaluate the audio and video quality. Coming from an Event, I was pleased with the speed of the interface. I didn't experience any lag, and the games I ran on it were as fast as I'd ever seen on a budget phone. I was glad to see that at least some apps could be disabled (if not removed).Though I knew I'd eventually root the phone, I could see myself being satisfied decently even if I didn't. The fact that I could effectively use a card larger than 32 GB was awesome to behold. A great thing, as it's not too expensive to get a 64 GB card these days. The Transcend Class 10 I chose was $35 at B&H; Photo in New York City (plus a few bucks for one day USPS Priority Mail).Once activated, a few of the Virgin Mobile apps downloaded onto my phone. Thankfully, only three apps were loaded. Two of them can be disabled, so you can avoid having them run in the background.About four days into running the phone unrooted (and two weeks of research on rooting), I finally did the deed. I rooted the phone, divided the external SD card to expand the small bit of internal memory, and used a couple of linking apps to also help with expanding memory. I loaded a bunch of apps I was using with my Kyocera Event onto the phone. Based on a short list that I found on vmroms.com, I removed a few apps from the phone. I now have something that really does feel like a tiny PC with a phone attached to it. All for around $130! It's not exactly a Samsung S3 or S4, but whatever. I'm still not sure I'll use the overclock kernel that one user created on androidforums (for now). No serious problems have been reported with using it. The overclock kernel raises the speed of both the main CPU, and the graphics processor beyond stock speeds.I can say I would recommend this phone for anyone that wants a powerhouse on a small budget, if you don't mind the rooting process. I've rooted every Android device I've owned since 2011 (four in total), but only after at least a few weeks of asking questions, researching the issues, and making up my own mind about it.Even if you don't root it, you can still do well with this phone. There are several good alternatives to the official apps of most social sites that won't take your RAM out for a late, fattening dinner. If you don't care for large, possibly addictive games, you'll do fine. Anyway, if you don't root, I'd bet you can enjoy this phone for the amount of video and music that can be stored on it. The dual core CPU and fast graphics are just fine for entertaining. Plus, now you can video chat with your pals on Skype... a lot can be done without rooting.

A1UQBFCERIP7VJ,B00EAYZ264,Margaret Picky,"[0, 0]","These VOXO&#581; HD VXG33X Bluetooth Headphones are a nice surprise: a high-quality set of portable headphones from a brand previously unknown to the U.S. market. They are very handsome, with attention to proportion, detail, materials and construction. They are a pleasure to use, combining quality audio with painless Bluetooth connection, intuitive controls, and a comfortable fit.The headband is about 1 1/4 inches wide and is padded with at the top. Unlike some over-the-ear headphones, these apply just the right amount of pressure to stay in place yet remain comfortable over extended periods. Each earpiece can be precisely adjusted within a 1 1/2 inch range for exact fit. They also swivel about 15 degrees in all directions and have exactly the right thickness of padding for comfort and isolation without bottoming out. The padding is covered with a protein leather that is very soft and is not prone to retaining heat and moisture. I am very pleased with the fit and comfort of these headphones even after several hours of continuous use.The Bluetooth is the latest generation and the CSR8645 chip uses the aptX codec so it is audibly equivalent to a wired connection. Range is about 30 feet, the same as my other Bluetooth devices. The microphone for telephone use is clear, although it does pick up ambient noise. They are HD voice-enabled, and that technology began being implemented by U.S. telephony carriers in early 2013.The VOXO&#581; headphones are intended for use with portable devices but the sound quality produced by the 40 mm drivers is pleasant enough for everyday use. The sound is as good as similar headphones selling for twice the price and is up to the standards set by their appearance and comfort.Sound isolation is good for on-ear headphones, so that while listening to music, ambient noise is dampened but not completely excluded. Spatial ambiance and soundstage are better than most on-ear headphones, although certainly not as good as what would be expected from an open-back, over-the-ear headphone. Impedance is average; as with all headphones, it is best to turn the source volume up and then adjust the listening volume with the headphone controls.The sound is well-balanced with the slight bass emphasis that is expected in portable headphones&#8212;but it is not at the expense of treble. I was pleasantly surprised that flutes and violins were just as full and detailed as bass instruments. I have never noticed any muddiness, sibilance, or other distortion. These are quite versatile headphones and the sound quality is higher than average, certainly much better than would be expected in this price range.They are shipped in a sturdy box that can be used for storage or they can be folded to under 4 x 7 x 2 1/2 in. to fit in the stretchy sueded storage pouch. A USB charging cable is included as well as a 38 in. 3.5 mm audio cable; either will to allow them to be used as wired headphones without relying on the rechargeable battery or Bluetooth.The instruction pamphlet is easy to follow and organizes control functions in charts for easy reference. I didn't actually need to refer to it as there is nothing tricky about the way these headphones work. There is also a very generous warranty.Three hours of charging the lithium ion battery will give at least fourteen hours of listening at moderate volume. Fully charge the battery before first use.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review. I have enjoyed using these headphones because of the combination of comfort and enjoyable sound quality and would definitely recommend them to others.Specifications:Sound pressure level - 108 dBImpedance - 64 &#120628;Frequency response 10-20 HzBluetooth - 4.0NFC-enabledAACaptXHD voice with echo cancellationBattery - 430 mAhSize - 176 x 165 x 32 mmWeight - 173 g (Actual 179 g or 6.3 oz.)",5.0,Surprising comfort and sound quality that matches the good looks,1384041600,"11 10, 2013",these voxo hd vxgx bluetooth headphones are a nice surprise a highquality set of portable headphones from a brand previously unknown to the us market they are very handsome with attention to proportion detail materials and construction they are a pleasure to use combining quality audio with painless bluetooth connection intuitive controls and a comfortable fitthe headband is about   inches wide and is padded with at the top unlike some overtheear headphones these apply just the right amount of pressure to stay in place yet remain comfortable over extended periods each earpiece can be precisely adjusted within a   inch range for exact fit they also swivel about  degrees in all directions and have exactly the right thickness of padding for comfort and isolation without bottoming out the padding is covered with a protein leather that is very soft and is not prone to retaining heat and moisture i am very pleased with the fit and comfort of these headphones even after several hours of continuous usethe bluetooth is the latest generation and the csr chip uses the aptx codec so it is audibly equivalent to a wired connection range is about  feet the same as my other bluetooth devices the microphone for telephone use is clear although it does pick up ambient noise they are hd voiceenabled and that technology began being implemented by us telephony carriers in early the voxo headphones are intended for use with portable devices but the sound quality produced by the  mm drivers is pleasant enough for everyday use the sound is as good as similar headphones selling for twice the price and is up to the standards set by their appearance and comfortsound isolation is good for onear headphones so that while listening to music ambient noise is dampened but not completely excluded spatial ambiance and soundstage are better than most onear headphones although certainly not as good as what would be expected from an openback overtheear headphone impedance is average as with all headphones it is best to turn the source volume up and then adjust the listening volume with the headphone controlsthe sound is wellbalanced with the slight bass emphasis that is expected in portable headphonesbut it is not at the expense of treble i was pleasantly surprised that flutes and violins were just as full and detailed as bass instruments i have never noticed any muddiness sibilance or other distortion these are quite versatile headphones and the sound quality is higher than average certainly much better than would be expected in this price rangethey are shipped in a sturdy box that can be used for storage or they can be folded to under  x  x   in to fit in the stretchy sueded storage pouch a usb charging cable is included as well as a  in  mm audio cable either will to allow them to be used as wired headphones without relying on the rechargeable battery or bluetooththe instruction pamphlet is easy to follow and organizes control functions in charts for easy reference i didnt actually need to refer to it as there is nothing tricky about the way these headphones work there is also a very generous warrantythree hours of charging the lithium ion battery will give at least fourteen hours of listening at moderate volume fully charge the battery before first usea sample was provided for testing and unbiased review i have enjoyed using these headphones because of the combination of comfort and enjoyable sound quality and would definitely recommend them to othersspecificationssound pressure level   dbimpedance   frequency response  hzbluetooth  nfcenabledaacaptxhd voice with echo cancellationbattery   mahsize   x  x  mmweight   g actual  g or  oz,joy,joy
A25C2M3QF9G7OQ,B00BJBX132,Comdet,"[2, 2]","This power bank is no lightweight - both figuratively and literally. It has an impressive 12,000mAh capacity which is great when it comes to utility, but it comes at a cost: size and weight. It clocks in at a hefty 11.5 ounces, and measures about 3 inches wide and 5.75 inches tall.To help keep the size manageable, the edges are rounded so it feels very comfortable in hand. I also appreciate the ergonomics of the device - it has 4 USB ports at the top so you can keep the power bank upright, on its side, or on its edge when in use. All edges are flat so it usually stays put however it's positioned. I say ""usually"" since it did topple over on me when I bumped it while it was positioned upright. A broader base on the bottom edge would have been more functional, rather than the rounded off (but admittedly more attractive) styling.The overall build quality seems good. The case is plastic (white on both sides and silver on the edge). All the ports seems well-fastened, and didn't budge at all when I stressed the cords.It has four charging ports. All are 5V, with one each for 0.5A, 1.0A, 1.3A and 2.1A. The rating for each port is printed clearly on the case, which is a welcome addition. It has a 4 LED ""gas gauge"" to show the power level remaining, and a micro USB port for input charging. There's an on/off button that also serves to illuminate the charge remaining indicator.It comes with a wide range of connectors (I won't list them here since they are in the product description) to cover pretty much any charging situation. It also comes with a nice drawstring pouch (about 3.75 wide and 5.75 tall and made of good quality nylon) to hold all the attachments. You can also use the pouch to hold the power bank itself, but it's about an inch too short to completely encase the device.The one thing it lacks, however, is a charger (e.g., a USB AC adapter). One is sold separately. The manual states that a 500mA charger should not be used. Unfortunately, all I had was a 500mA charger. I emailed the company, and was told that a 500mA charger is fine in that it won't damage the charge bank, but it will take much longer to charge. That was certainly the case - it took overnight and then some (about 15 hours) to bring the charge bank from 1 LED (low charge) to 4 LEDs (full charge) using the 500mA charger I had. According to the email I received, the power bank can work with a charger up to 2000mA. (Note, however, that on the back of the device it states a max input of 1500mA). A higher powered charger would certainly bring the charge time down to a more reasonable length of time.Nothing much to say about usage other than it works! It is functionally identical to pretty much every other power bank I've used other than the fact that the 12,000 mAh capacity allowed me to bring my Kindle Fire 8.9 from 10% to 90% charge, and still had enough juice to bring my Samsung phone from nearly empty to full charge. Smaller power banks I've used (such as 6,000 or 7,500 mAh) would be empty before even reaching the 60% mark on just the Fire.This is well worth considering if you want a lot of spare ""juice"" at the ready, and are willing to deal with the larger size and weight of a higher mAh device. It's well-made, and at the current price, a very good value when you figure the cost per mAh.

A30UP2KKD5IQEP,B005RUOUHW,Soar,"[1, 2]","I use a bluetooth headset daily for hours for work (mainly conference calls that I speak a lot on) and ALWAYS when I'm on the phone in a car.  I am constantly on the lookout for improved headsets.When I review a headset, there are 3 categories I consider:1. Sound - how well I can hear the conversation2. Microphone - how well the other person(s) can hear me3. Fit - how easy the headset it to put on and how it feels wearing it for an hour or three for long callsMy review of the Jabra SUPREME Headset:Sound:  Fantastic.  The Jabra SUPREME does very very well in the sound category.  The sound was clear and had the best volume, without losing sound quality, of any headset I have used.  There is one annoying feature - when I turn the sound all the way up on my phone, the headset sound is not at max, I need to then use the little buttons on the headset to turn up the sound to max.Microphone:  Not the best.  I did a number of tests between my current headset of choice,Plantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset, and the Jabra SUPREME.  Every person I tested this with thought the Plantronics Voyager PRO+ was distinctly better.  If I started with the Jabra SUPREME, there were no complaints about the sound quality, but when I paused a moment and switched headsets (without saying what I was doing), the feedback I got was... 'wow you sound much better, what did you do?'.  Every time Plantronics came out ahead.Fit:  Mediocre.  I really do not like the rubber covering over the ear speaker used on this headset.  I carry my headset in my pocket and the silly cover kept falling off.  Beyond that, the little loop behind the ear for the headset was surprisingly annoying and clumsy to put on when in a hurry trying to answer a call.  Also, the ear loop did not hold the headset tightly to my ear, if I bent over or leaned to far, the headset would fall off.Other characteristics....  The headset pairs very quickly (you fold it to turn it off and unfold it to turn it on and answer a call).  The charging port has a tiny (and annoying) little plastic plug covering it, like some cameras.  I did not care about the voice recognition commands, so never used them.  The headset talks to you a fair amount with status.  If I used the headset more regularly, I'd probably turn that off.Overall... + Great sound, -1 for microphone, -1 for fit.  The fantastic sound of the Jabra SUPREME does not outweigh the shortcomings in the microphone to me.  I could live with the fit, but I can't live with a so-so microphone.",3.0,From someone who uses headsets a lot,1329177600,"02 14, 2012",i use a bluetooth headset daily for hours for work mainly conference calls that i speak a lot on and always when im on the phone in a car  i am constantly on the lookout for improved headsetswhen i review a headset there are  categories i consider sound  how well i can hear the conversation microphone  how well the other persons can hear me fit  how easy the headset it to put on and how it feels wearing it for an hour or three for long callsmy review of the jabra supreme headsetsound  fantastic  the jabra supreme does very very well in the sound category  the sound was clear and had the best volume without losing sound quality of any headset i have used  there is one annoying feature  when i turn the sound all the way up on my phone the headset sound is not at max i need to then use the little buttons on the headset to turn up the sound to maxmicrophone  not the best  i did a number of tests between my current headset of choiceplantronics voyager pro bluetooth headset and the jabra supreme  every person i tested this with thought the plantronics voyager pro was distinctly better  if i started with the jabra supreme there were no complaints about the sound quality but when i paused a moment and switched headsets without saying what i was doing the feedback i got was wow you sound much better what did you do  every time plantronics came out aheadfit  mediocre  i really do not like the rubber covering over the ear speaker used on this headset  i carry my headset in my pocket and the silly cover kept falling off  beyond that the little loop behind the ear for the headset was surprisingly annoying and clumsy to put on when in a hurry trying to answer a call  also the ear loop did not hold the headset tightly to my ear if i bent over or leaned to far the headset would fall offother characteristics  the headset pairs very quickly you fold it to turn it off and unfold it to turn it on and answer a call  the charging port has a tiny and annoying little plastic plug covering it like some cameras  i did not care about the voice recognition commands so never used them  the headset talks to you a fair amount with status  if i used the headset more regularly id probably turn that offoverall  great sound  for microphone  for fit  the fantastic sound of the jabra supreme does not outweigh the shortcomings in the microphone to me  i could live with the fit but i cant live with a soso microphone,joy,joy

Which is great, except I found it really easily to get my skin caught in it on my arm.  Left me with at least one bruise.

This means it looks good from the top, but the phone is pushing into your arm, including the headphone jack (this is annoying).  You can also feel the phone itself pressing into your arm.  Also because there is a whole for the headphone jack, sweat can also get in there.Other designs that put the iPhone above the band, solve most of these issues, but don't look as good.

A multi-functional basic phone with a QWERTY keyboard that works great for calls and texts.I was looking for a replacement for my Nokia C3 and found that most of my options with a full keyboard were RIM Blackberries, which, honestly, are just too much phone for me. All I wanted was a phone with a camera, alarm, speakerphone, and ability to easily send and receive multiple texts.For $40 this phone has huge bang for the buck. It is really intuitive for being marketed as low-end: menus are easy to navigate, lots of options for ring and alert tones, and the text messaging provides both inbox and conversation views. Call quality is surprisingly good. I did have one call so far that sounded a little grainy but overall voice quality is better than most smartphones I've used.They keyboard is slightly cramped due to its small size and the buttons are a bit slippery. Nothing that you don't get used to, however. I didn't think I would want a phone this small (slightly smaller than a deck of cards), but its compact size is actually a nice change from carrying around a bulky/awkward phone. The casing isn't super sturdy but the phone overall is a solid little brick.Before this phone I have tried the Moto Atrix, iPhone 3 (hated paying for data and smartphones are battery hogs), Nokia C3 (got buggy after 3 years), Blackberry Pearl (too complicated), and the AT&T; Z431 (just awful). Amazingly, this little thing has been the best of the bunch so far.Nice, bright screen, dedicated camera and messaging buttons.

Right out of the box the unit was ready to charge my portable devices. After giving the unit a full charge, I put the Powerpak to the test by charging a completed depleted Iphone 5 and Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone simultaneously. Within 30 minutes both units were already at a 25% charge and both phones were completely charged at 100% at the 2 1/2 hour mark.  The Powerpak remained cool to the touch during the entire charging process.The Newtrent Powerpak comes with a android type charging cable which must be plugged into a USB capable wall charger. The wall charger is not supplied, but most products come with a wall charger anyway.  The same cable can then be used to charge an Android smartphone type device. It also comes with a felt storage bag with drawstrings conducive to the unit.  Once your device is fully charged the device powers down on it's own maintaining it's reserve power to charge future devices.  While charging the Powerpak a small blue/green diode is visible on the unit.  When charging the Powerpak alone, the diode  also acts as indicator to display the charge status of the Powerpak using three different diode/indicator colors.The New Trent Powerpak is light weight and can be easily placed in a coat pocket, hand bag or back-pack for easy transport.  The only thing that I would suggest to improve this product is that the charging diode/indicator remain lit while the unit is charging devices.  Otherwise, this is an exceptional model simply because it can charge two units at once in virtually no time at all.

A2SZLNSI5KOQJT,B00E2TT8W6,Carrie,"[1, 1]","I and my friends tested 3 OXA external battery packs on a recent international trip:OXA 8000mAb Aluminum Alloy Ultrathin Power Bank (8.6 oz);OXA 8000mAh Solar External Battery Pack (6.7 oz); andOXA Juice Box S2 1000 mAh (10.1 oz)Of the three external battery packs, despite its additional weight/bulk and what seemed to be a little slower job in charging, I preferred the OXA Juice Box S2 because of its digital battery status read-out.The solar pack can recharge itself by placing it in a sunny windowsill but it did take a LONG time to charge using solar only.  Luckily it can also be charged with a USB cable.  But, given that it is suppose to be a solar charger, this external pack is more of a fail.Overall, however, everyone was very happy with the performance of all external batteries, and all of our devices (Samsung tablet, iPad, iPhones, Nokia smartphone) charged effortlessly while we were using transportation that did have outlets.  The Ultrathin & Juice box battery packs charge via USB by plugging them into your computer.  If you have a USB/wall charger adapter, this will work too (I used this method & easily charged the power unit overnight).The solar external battery probably isn't worth the purchase unless you will be traveling a long time & completely deplete your other external battery packs with no way to recharge them.** Make sure that the OXA charger you are interested in will support your device.Thumbs up for the Ultrathin & Juice Box OXA products.

A3JL3YQYI7OR5O,B00BW6GH76,Jason Chamberlain,"[0, 0]","I had used an Otterbox Defender before this case. I was tired of the bulk of the Otterbox, plus I wanted a case I could remove more easily. I also wanted something more attractive. I didn't like any of the non-black options available for the Otterbox, so I went with this in red.I really like how this case looks. As others have noted, it fits around the front, but just enough so that you can put the phone face-down. I feel like it is on securely even though the overlap is barely 1/8&#34;. I feel pretty secure about dropping my phone in this case too. I don't feel quite as secure as I did with the double-layered Otterbox Defender, but I still feel like the phone is protected.This is good because for the first 2 weeks I constantly felt like I was about to drop my phone. The S4 is a big device and I don't have particularly large hands, so this creates a problem for me. I liked being able to slide my hand up the back of the Otterbox and feel the friction as it rested on my fingers. This case feels like it is going to jump out of my hand, so I've had to change my habits a little bit. The shiny coating on the back looks great, but it is definitely slippery.Nevertheless, I like how this case provides slim protection for my phone and I am willing to deal with the slick back. The front is not as slippery, so I put the phone face-down in the passenger seat while I drive. This keeps it from sliding around every time I turn.One other small complaint is that I really have to push hard to get the power button to work. I noticed that there is just an indentation where the power button goes, but the volume buttons seem to have a little extra rubber to push on them. This is a very minor complaint compared to the lack of friction.

One of the things it does is make my office workday more enjoyable by providing a wealth of music and podcast entertainment options.  I can't wear headphones at the office and my IPhone speakers are not suitable for high-quality playback.My solution has been to place an external speaker next to my computer monitor.  I've moved from a speaker that was directly connected to my smartphone to several external Bluetooth speakers. My latest is Arctic's S113BT portable Bluetooth speaker. At 290 grams and measuring 56 x 49 x 147 mm, the S113BT is small enough to fit beneath my monitor.  It's powered by a micro-USB cord and holds about an eight-hour charge.  Arctic says that it can remain in standby mode for about 700 hours when fully charged.The S311BT has a six-watt amplifier.  Like all small speakers that I have used, it sounds a little tin-like, but is acceptable for office and portable use.  Just understand that we not talking about Bose-level speaker quality (how could we at a price tag around $50?).  Connectivity with my IPhone is a breeze with Arctic's advanced Bluetooth interface.The unit I tested is dark black, which helps it blend into my office environment.  Another positive for the S113BT is the rubber bumper on the outside of the unit that makes it easy to handle and helps to absorb shock if the unit is dropped.  I have not used the speaker outside my office, but I get the impression it would be a sturdy tool at the beach or on the trail.

A1ZJSYEQQDIDAA,B0092QSQ3Q,"D. Connally ""Connada""","[0, 0]","This appears to be a quality product, but has a couple flaws that may not make it a good choice for you.  First, the packaging is very nice, I find it hard to believe they can afford to provide this package for the price.  Upon putting the screen protector on I had multiple ""microbubbles"" and streaks.  It looked horrible, but all the reviews, and even Skinomi, indicated that this would improve over the next couple weeks until the screen protector was clear.  Over the next three days the screen did clear up a bit, but before all the microbubbles disappeared my case (a Belkin Grip Candy) managed to push up the edge of the screen protector, ultimately ruining the screen protector.  If I had not had a case, or had a different case that didn't contact the edge of the screen protector, I suspect the screen protector would be clear and functioning great at this point.With my original order, Skinomi provided me with a certificate to get a second screen protector for free.  I submitted the certificate and in about a week I recieved my free screen protector kit.  That night I installed it.  I used much more of their spray than I did the first time, and the screen protector installed much easier and looked much better right from the beginning.  I let my phone sit for about 12 hours over night.  In the morning it looked pretty good, although I still had a few of those microbubbles.  I popped my phone back into it's case, and within a hour my case was once again pushing up the corner of the screen protector.  I thought this might happen, but with the aluminum exterior on the iphone 5 I'm certainly not going to carry my phone without a case.  And since the screen is pretty scratch resistent (and aluminum is not), I figure it's better to have a good case than a good screen protector, at least for the short term.  Thus, the Skinomi screen protector didn't work out for me.I did notice that the screen protector left no residue behind when I removed it.  Also, the screen protector had a softer texture to it than the dry install screen protectors I have used in the past.The screen protector appears like it would work great if you don't use a case, or you have a case that doesn't contact the edge of the screen protector.  If you have a case that will contact the edges of the screen protector (such as the Belkin Grip Candy), this screen protector probably won't last long.  Second, this is the first screen protector I've used that had these microbubbles.  They apparently go away, but that may take a couple days to a couple weeks.  Many other screen protectors are flawless right from the beginning.

So if you are looking for a wireless headset, do not buy this product. (EDIT: The word ""Bluetooth"" has since been removed from the product title).Having said that, there are plenty of great features and attributes that make this headset worth owning.AUDIO QUALITY: 4/5Overall, the sound quality is very good.  I sampled some of my favorite songs, as well as various movie clips.  It handled everything I threw at it, so I don't have any complaints about the performance of the speakers.COMFORT: 4/5The earpieces are nicely cushioned with leather, and the overall comfort of the set is above average.  Though the unit seems a bit bulky at first, it is very lightweight and I had no problem keeping it on for 1-2 hours at a time.  The headpiece is easy to adjust and fits well, although it would have been nice if the earpieces were able to swivel a bit more.  One very good thing in the product design is that there is only one cable (rather than it splitting to both ears as it does in some other models) - this helps prevent tangles.COMPATIBILITY: 4/5There are two different cables included in the package.  One is a ""straight-through"" cable, which is a standard 3.5mm cable which would be used on all devices - MP3 players, laptops, etc.  The second cable is the ""remote"" cable; this one includes a built-in microphone and remote control (which can start/stop playback and increase/decrease volume).  The remote cable won't work on all devices, but it is designed to function specifically for apple products - iPod, iPhone, and iPad.EXTRAS: 3/5The packaging for the headphones is very nice and each to open (unlike many other headphones).

A360VP3RBMJFDL,B0094G44PS,Voyn238,"[2, 3]","I recently upgraded from the iPod Touch 3 to the iPod Touch 5, which as you probably already know, does not have an analog audio out because of the new Lightning connector. I was previously using my old iPod in the car with this cable: (B00490OVM0and a car USB charger. The cable provides USB charging for the device and also feeds audio to the car's aux input via the 3.5mm plug.That setup worked great in my 2012 Equinox until the upgrade, and works great now with this Bluetooth adapter.I was looking for a solution to connect the new iPod to my stereo, and found a handful of devices similar to this here on Amazon. I went with this one, and I'm glad I did. Pairing is very easy, and I've paired it to my iPod and to my Android phone. When I start the car, the USB charger gets power and passes this along to the Bluetooth adapter. The adapter quickly and automatically reconnects with the iPod and I'm ready to go. When I turn the car off and open the door, the USB charger loses power and so does this adapter. The iPod eventually figures out that it's lost connection and stops playing, but it takes about 15 to 20 seconds so if it's important to pick up where I left off, I have to hit pause first. The only thing this setup doesn't do is allow me to charge the iPod while playing music. No big deal, the iPod usually has plenty of battery. I can always hook it up to another charger if I'm truly desperate for juice.I was worried at first that my various devices would fight for control of this thing, but I believe it remember whichever one it was paired to last and tries to connect with that one first. Either that, or the iPod jumps first and always wins. Either way, it works well for me.Sound quality is just fine for a car environment. Make sure the volume on your music device is all the way up and you should be fine. Is it 192kHz/24-bit sound? Of course not, and neither are your MP3s or your Bluetooth device. In my case, it wouldn't much matter even if they were, because I'd probably lose the extra quality to road noise.If you're using this on a sound dock, be sure to do some research first and find out whether your dock uses analog or digital signals from the iPod. This will work with analog ones but not digital (our Philips iOS alarm clock works great with this too, by the way).One other thing to note, and I swear I'm done :-D  This adapter ONLY handles audio for music, and will in no way act as a speakerphone. I don't think they ever claim that it does, but I feel I should point it out.Enjoy!UPDATE 03-06-13After using this for several months, I have one tiny gripe to report: If you pause your music playback while ordering at a drivethrough or to answer a phonecall, you're very likely to hear nothing when you restart playback. To get sound back, you have to ""reboot"" the receiver, which for me means opening up the console lid and unplugging the USB cable, waiting a few seconds, and then plugging it back in. The receiver reboots and pairs up again automatically. Pause duration doesn't seem to have a lot to do with it, as I've paused it for less than 5 seconds and had audio drop out, and have left it paused for over 10 minutes with no audio dropout. I'm able to duplicate this issue on my home stereo with this adapter plugged into an old iPod dock, so I'm fairly certain it's not my in-car setup that's to blame. Not sure what's going on, but I *am* looking for an alternate Bluetooth receiver that hopefully won't do this.Another thing I should mention is that with the release of Evasi0n, I've jailbroken my iPod and am using this Bluetooth receiver as the trigger for SBProfiles to put the iPod in ""car mode"". SBProfiles allows user-defined profiles to be triggered by user-defined events, including pairing to specific Bluetooth devices (""I-Link"", in this case). When a profile is triggered, it can be manipulate any toggles provided by SBSettings. When I plug the iPod into a power source and connect it to ""I-Link"" during daylight hours, the iPod will switch to my ""car"" profile which turn brightness to full, disables AutoLock (so the screen never dims or turns off on its own), and opens the Music app. After 6:45PM, it goes into my ""car @ night"" mode which does mostly the same things but turns the brightness to 30% so it doesn't blind me when the rest of the world is dark. I've also created a profile called ""un-car"" to revert these changes when connection to this bluetooth device is lost (otherwise the unit would permanently stay in car mode and the screen would never turn itself off and my battery life would suffer terribly). This isn't much, but it tickles the hell out of me that this can be done. I suppose it doesn't have a lot to do with this receiver, but I figured it was worth a mention and may give some inspiration to someone out there.",4.0,Great product!

A34SDL7IQ76CXV,B00AGA6FLC,Richard,"[16, 38]","Got the protectors quickly, the packaging was top notch and the large cleaning cloth was nice. Also appreciated the green tint for positioning. I watched two installation videos on Youtube so that helped. The first protector I installed but there was a dust bubble, so I used the dust sticker to lift the protector and then for some reason thought it would be a good idea to use the cleaning cloth to lift it up and hold it while i used the sticker, of course this got fuzz from the towel all over the underside of the protector. This was my fault.On to protector #2. Installed perfectly, I was rubbing out bubbles to the edges, and somehow one bubble turned into a large run, almost like you see in panty hose. After this there was no way I could get it out. I think it deformed the material somehow.The third one is pretty much perfect, at the top it doesn't look like it is adhering very well but overall im happy and the screen is bright and clear.I guess it's a good thing I got three of them. Hopefully I just got a couple bad ones.EDIT: I have been asked repeatedly by the seller to edit this review, so I will.

A1Q4S3NQB8ZTOP,B002RL8TFS,"P@BL() ""MenesesInc""","[0, 0]","I've owned and loved the Motorola H7XX series bluetooth headsets (H700, H710 and H715).  Between them, I've also purchased and returned the Plantronics Voyager 510 and PRO due to how functional the Motorola's H7XX series as been for me.  I've always enjoyed the fact that all I have to do to pair a phone is open it up and enter the code on my phone.  When I want to turn it off, I simply close it. When I want to store it, it nicely fits in either the small or normal jean pockets (I never really got that from Plantronics and a reason for always coming back to the H7XX series.One thing I will note though is that all my headsets have gone bad within that 1 year warranty (not sure if its because I use it like hell or what).  Motorola's warranty has been excellent and they have always stood by their warranty every single time.About 9 months into my H715 the mic stopped working.  Others could not hear anything regardless of which phone I paired up with.  I called Motorola and explained the situation, we did some further troubleshooting and then they put together an RMA for me.  One draw back was that they are no longer manufacturing the H715's (bummer).  So they were going to replace it with a H720 (no way).  I explained to Motorola that I purposely purchased the H715 due to its ability to pair with (2) phones which I use extremely everyday (iPhone and Bold 9700) but the H720 does not have that feature.  She talked things over with her manager and they suggested that they could send me a H17 (I've never tried any other Motorola bluetooth headsets other then the H7XX series so I was somewhat hesitant).  They explained to me that it also had a boom mic similar to the H7XX series and the option of placing it in the ear (one reason Plantronics never really worked out for me) or placing outside the ear with an ear loop similar to the H7XX series.  They also explained that the H17 could pair with (2) phones.  So, I agreed.  When I received the phone, I thought they had sent me like an iPhone.  The packaging has changed from a regular headset box to what I would call... simply... Art (when you get the retail packaging you'll know what I'm mean).So, the in ear thing didn't work for me, I guess its just me, but the over the ear loop worked for me exactly like the H7XX series.  The H17 has really cool voice prompts when you open the boom, ""You are paired with Phone 1, battery is high, you are paired with Phone 2"".  The H17's volume is LOUD (coming from the H7XX series it is LOUD).  I actually have to lower it now.  The H17 is extremely small and even more compact then the H7XX series.  One cool thing it does is that it allows you to call from either Phone 1, by pressing the call button or call from phone 2 by pressing the call button and the volume button.  Non of the H7XX series headset had this nice feature.  I would normally have to hold the call button to redial from the previous phone but if I had to call from phone 2, I would have to start the call from the phone itself (great feature).I will continue to update this review if anything comes up.  I hope this H17 last way beyond the 1 year warranty if not, I know first hand that Motorola stands by its warranty.  One final note, the representative did tell me that the H730 would be coming out soon and is designed after the new H720 but with more features one being the ability to connect to (2) phones.  Depending on how things go with the H17, I might convert to the H1X series.***UPDATE 02/07/2011***I still stand by the review for this product and I can't fault it for the following update and thus I cannot take a STAR away from it.  This updated is geared towards professionals or those whom use their bluetooth excessively on one sitting.  As mentioned above, I have personally have used the  H7XX series and battery life is great with up to 12 hours of talk time.  I did not notice this ""feature"" on the H7XX until I was ""moved"" over to the H17.  As stated previously, the H17 is smaller and thus will have less talk time.  But I need talk time to be in the 6-8 hour range which the H7XX gave me but the H17 cannot.  Come to think of it, I will remove a STAR for one reason.  On the H7XX series, once I was hitting the battery ""limit"", the headset would worn me with various tones but whomever I was working with could still hear me crystal clear.  In the same scenario, the H17's voice quality is degraded significantly without any type of warning while wearing the headset.  People with whom I'm working with continuously say I'm cutting out around the time the H17 hits its battery ""limit"".  No type of warning, very annoying!!!Finally, I've gone out and purchased the H730 (w00t) and hopefully Motorola kept it the ""same""...",4.0,"Prior H700, H710, H715 Owner",1285718400,"09 29, 2010",ive owned and loved the motorola hxx series bluetooth headsets h h and h  between them ive also purchased and returned the plantronics voyager  and pro due to how functional the motorolas hxx series as been for me  ive always enjoyed the fact that all i have to do to pair a phone is open it up and enter the code on my phone  when i want to turn it off i simply close it when i want to store it it nicely fits in either the small or normal jean pockets i never really got that from plantronics and a reason for always coming back to the hxx seriesone thing i will note though is that all my headsets have gone bad within that  year warranty not sure if its because i use it like hell or what  motorolas warranty has been excellent and they have always stood by their warranty every single timeabout  months into my h the mic stopped working  others could not hear anything regardless of which phone i paired up with  i called motorola and explained the situation we did some further troubleshooting and then they put together an rma for me  one draw back was that they are no longer manufacturing the hs bummer  so they were going to replace it with a h no way  i explained to motorola that i purposely purchased the h due to its ability to pair with  phones which i use extremely everyday iphone and bold  but the h does not have that feature  she talked things over with her manager and they suggested that they could send me a h ive never tried any other motorola bluetooth headsets other then the hxx series so i was somewhat hesitant  they explained to me that it also had a boom mic similar to the hxx series and the option of placing it in the ear one reason plantronics never really worked out for me or placing outside the ear with an ear loop similar to the hxx series  they also explained that the h could pair with  phones  so i agreed  when i received the phone i thought they had sent me like an iphone  the packaging has changed from a regular headset box to what i would call simply art when you get the retail packaging youll know what im meanso the in ear thing didnt work for me i guess its just me but the over the ear loop worked for me exactly like the hxx series  the h has really cool voice prompts when you open the boom you are paired with phone  battery is high you are paired with phone   the hs volume is loud coming from the hxx series it is loud  i actually have to lower it now  the h is extremely small and even more compact then the hxx series  one cool thing it does is that it allows you to call from either phone  by pressing the call button or call from phone  by pressing the call button and the volume button  non of the hxx series headset had this nice feature  i would normally have to hold the call button to redial from the previous phone but if i had to call from phone  i would have to start the call from the phone itself great featurei will continue to update this review if anything comes up  i hope this h last way beyond the  year warranty if not i know first hand that motorola stands by its warranty  one final note the representative did tell me that the h would be coming out soon and is designed after the new h but with more features one being the ability to connect to  phones  depending on how things go with the h i might convert to the hx seriesupdate i still stand by the review for this product and i cant fault it for the following update and thus i cannot take a star away from it  this updated is geared towards professionals or those whom use their bluetooth excessively on one sitting  as mentioned above i have personally have used the  hxx series and battery life is great with up to  hours of talk time  i did not notice this feature on the hxx until i was moved over to the h  as stated previously the h is smaller and thus will have less talk time  but i need talk time to be in the  hour range which the hxx gave me but the h cannot  come to think of it i will remove a star for one reason  on the hxx series once i was hitting the battery limit the headset would worn me with various tones but whomever i was working with could still hear me crystal clear  in the same scenario the hs voice quality is degraded significantly without any type of warning while wearing the headset  people with whom im working with continuously say im cutting out around the time the h hits its battery limit  no type of warning very annoyingfinally ive gone out and purchased the h wt and hopefully motorola kept it the same,joy,joy

This case is pretty, but it won't do what a case is meant to do. I can't even get this case to close properly around my phone with the all-over plastic screen protector I bought in the mall (something called ""ghost armor""). The box this case comes in would do a better job protecting your phone than the case itself.So instead, I bought an ugly white and blue rubber case from Five Below, which sells everything for five dollars and under. Guess what? That cheap case actually protects my phone.

AZXFS8GCTSQ5R,B00JFGIVVA,NF,"[2, 4]","My first impression of this speaker was favorable. The diamond dome is pretty decorative, even without the light show. With the light show, it's beautiful. The speaker is roughly the size of one of those ""Magic 8 Ball"" toys from Mattel, or approximately 5 inches in diameter. The device comes with a felt carrying bag for protection should you feel moved to carry it around.Light Show:One thing that isn't entirely clear from most of the pictures is that the base is offset in such a way that the lighted diamond top is actually at an angle. If you place the speaker in the center of your room, from the back you won't get the full effect.The light show has five modes: solid color, rainbow, and three different sound-reactive light shows. By default, the solid color mode will cycle through the various colors but you can pause it at a specific color if you like. If it's paused, you can manually advance to the next color in the sequence. The three reactive light show settings react to the volume of the sound being played, with louder sounds generating more light, just as you would expect.The light show level is adjustable in 65 steps, from barely visible to bright enough to light up a room. At the brightest levels, beginning at roughly level  45, the color begins to shift to nearly full white. The light blinks at the highest and lowest levels to let you know that you can't go further. The light show can also be ""muted,"" just as the sound can be muted. As far as I can tell, the three reactive light-show settings ignore the light show level you set; they are set only from the sound level.Volume:The volume level is adjustable in 12 steps, from inaudible to painfully loud (at least close up). The device would be overwhelmed by the noise of a loud party but for just about any other scenario, the device has the power to pump out enough sound for anything you need. At full volume, you can easily hear this speaker from another room, even if the door between the two rooms is closed.I found that the optimal placement of the speaker is in a corner, as that allows the sound to bounce off the wall, increasing the volume and resonance. That also gives the best light show view, as that places the unlighted back against the corner. That placement will also have the cord against the wall so that it won't interfere with room traffic.Sound Quality:The sound quality from this device is very good for its size and for this market. All too many of these external Bluetooth speakers are limited in sound quality, clarity, and volume. As noted above, the playback is pretty loud. At full volume from my Kindle Fire HDX, I did hear a bit of distortion, but otherwise, the sound remained clear throughout the full volume range.I used a CD of a really excellent female vocal group to test the high-end sound quality. The highs came through remarkably clearly, all things considered. The sound was noticeably less crisp than my living room receiver sound system but that's to be expected for a device that cost 20 times less.For the mid-range, I used some classical music CDs for testing. As with the high range, the sound was a bit less crisp than my reference system but the nuances came through satisfactorily at all levels, from the highest string passages to the lowest brass.At the low end, some of the bass is lost, of course. You just can't get true sub-woofer bass quality and power from a 5"" device like this. Overall, though, for this class of speaker, I thought they did a very good job on the bass.Battery Life:The manufacturer claims ten hours of life from a 1300 mAh Lithium-Polymer battery, which is at the high end for a device of this class. I didn't test the claim fully but I can say that I charged it overnight, then tested for hours, often at full volume, and the device hasn't shown any signs of losing power yet, so I wouldn't be surprised to find that the claim is pretty accurate. One interesting use for the device, by the way, is as a light source during a power outage. With no music playing, I suspect the device will light up a room fairly well and will stay lit for as long as a full day, since LEDs, even at full brightness, don't draw too much power.Plug/Charging Cable:The speaker comes with a plug and detachable USB to mini-USB cord, plus a remote control. I assume that any mini-USB cord will charge the speaker but I didn't have another cord available to double-check that. Note that this is a mini-USB connector, not micro-USB. Most Android phones and tablets use the latter. The charging cord also has a line-in connector, a 3.5mm mini-stereo connector, so you can plug your sound source directly into the device rather than using Bluetooth.Remote Control:The remote control is pretty tiny and I'm a bit concerned that I'll end up losing it. That would be unfortunate, since you cannot really control the device without it. There are no controls on the device itself, not even a power button. The remote control has the following functions:Power on/offBluetooth vs. Line inSound playback: play, pause, next, previousVolume: louder, softer, mutedLight: brighter, softer, mutedSolid color light show, including a separate button for selecting colors manuallyRainbow light showThree different sound-reactive light showsNote that there is a slot on the device itself for you to slide the remote into to help prevent you from losing it.App:There is a free app available that will allow you to control the device with much the same button layout as the remote control but the app is very limited. It's called ""BedTimeSocial"" on the Google Play store. The problem with the app is that it doesn't integrate with any other apps. If you are playing back music from, e.g., the Google Music Player and you start the BTS app, the sound shuts off. You can only play back music from the app's own playlist. The app allows you to set a ""sleep"" mode where the device will shut off after a specific period of time, as well as allowing you to set an alarm to wake to. You can even record a message and then wake to that message. I don't really need any of this functionality so I didn't spend a lot of time with the app and will likely be uninstalling it.Summary:So what did I like about the device? Very good sound quality and volume for its size, beautiful light show with enough variety to keep it entertaining, great battery life, ease of use (I had no problem pairing this with multiple sound sources), flexibility (Bluetooth or line-in), supplied remote and power cord/plug.What didn't I like? It's pricey and the app, honestly, isn't very good. I also didn't like the lack of controls on the device, although I can see why they were excluded, as there really isn't much of a place for them.I'm going to dock it one star for the price and for the lack of controls. But otherwise, I can recommend this as a really lovely Bluetooth speaker with very good sound and a beautiful light show.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.

A3PZS1Q9F3YOV2,B00AOW8I30,Alex and Shelly Tatistcheff,"[0, 0]",My initial reaction to this case was two-fold.  First I was impressed with the feel.  The leather-like back feels nice and is seamlessly fused to the TPU.  The second thing I noticed right away was that the power button cut-out is way to long.  At first I was wondering if they somehow sent the wrong case.  Why would you cutout such a large slot for the power button?I have gotten used to the power button cutout over the past few days and also realized the reason it's so large is to include the micro-sim slot.  I have never seen another case include the micro-sim slot with a cutout.  This seems completely unnecessary as the case isn't that hard to remove for an operation which honestly most people do once with their phones.  This moved them from 5 to 4 stars.I was ready to give this 4 stars until I read another reviewer mention the flash glare.  I don't use my camera's flash that often but when I tested it sure enough with the case on the LED flash glare is very obvious in photos vs. the case off.  This is clearly a design flaw resulting from not testing this case with the phone sufficiently.  No excuse for that - lose another star.Overall though the case gives good protection and I like the way it feels.  Yes it does add considerable bulk to the phone but there's no way around that really for this type of design.  The flash issue is kind of a pain and it means I'll have to remove it from the case to take any photos using the LED flash.  That might end up being a deal breaker over time but we'll see.Pros:Nice fitPolished designGreat feel - especially the leather-ish backGood drop protectionHolds phone securely but still easy to install/removeGood value for $Cons:Causes glare in flash photosPower cutout is way too big due to inclusion of micro-SIM slot,3.0,Wavering on 3 or 4 stars,1390176000,"01 20, 2014",my initial reaction to this case was twofold  first i was impressed with the feel  the leatherlike back feels nice and is seamlessly fused to the tpu  the second thing i noticed right away was that the power button cutout is way to long  at first i was wondering if they somehow sent the wrong case  why would you cutout such a large slot for the power buttoni have gotten used to the power button cutout over the past few days and also realized the reason its so large is to include the microsim slot  i have never seen another case include the microsim slot with a cutout  this seems completely unnecessary as the case isnt that hard to remove for an operation which honestly most people do once with their phones  this moved them from  to  starsi was ready to give this  stars until i read another reviewer mention the flash glare  i dont use my cameras flash that often but when i tested it sure enough with the case on the led flash glare is very obvious in photos vs the case off  this is clearly a design flaw resulting from not testing this case with the phone sufficiently  no excuse for that  lose another staroverall though the case gives good protection and i like the way it feels  yes it does add considerable bulk to the phone but theres no way around that really for this type of design  the flash issue is kind of a pain and it means ill have to remove it from the case to take any photos using the led flash  that might end up being a deal breaker over time but well seeprosnice fitpolished designgreat feel  especially the leatherish backgood drop protectionholds phone securely but still easy to installremovegood value for conscauses glare in flash photospower cutout is way too big due to inclusion of microsim slot,joy,joy

I bought an awesome Plantronics blutooth headset only to find that if you are using Skype for iphone it does not work! Works great on the iphone if you are using the regular phone though. For skype at my desktop I use the similar boom type plantronics model but because it has a 2.5mm plug I need to use and adapter and when I tried that with 2 different adapters and the earphone sound comes through but the mic does not (tried 2 different adapters!) so you can hear fine but the people on the other end can hear you only through the mic on your phone. In a horribly embarrassing moment I learned that muting the mic did not mean all of my coworkers on the other end of a conference call could not hear me yelling at my dog LOL!Anyway- forsome reason all of 3.5mm headsets that they are still making have the mic on the cord and because I tend to talk while I am doing other things people hear my hair or clothes or whatever brushing up agains the mic so FINALLY found one that had a boom mic AND a 3.5mm jack so I would not need an adapter! Wooohoo! Liberated from my desktop during phone calls finally!Since I used the desktop version of this mic I was already used to the earpiece. I won't lie- it took awhile. It is not uncomfortable in terms of fit (bluetooth one was) but it feels wierd and like it will fall out at any moment. After using it for sometime I have gotten comfortable that it will say in and when I am sitting at my desk I will often find I left it in my ear after ending the call ages ago!Bluetooth can be a great solution but it has its drawbacks (battery, connection quality etc) so I am baffled as to why everyone is leaving the wired ones behind. This is goofy looking for sure but I am not one to walk around the grocery store with this or any other headset on. When I am home or in my car and want to be hands free with a good connection I like a wired solution! If Skype for iphone had worked with bluetooth I would have settled for it since I had already bought it but until it does smartphone users who rely on voip will need this!The annoying thing is that there are lots of headsets out there that say 'works with iphone' and in reality they are 2.5mm plug heasets that come with an adapte. The MX505 also comes in a 2.5mm plug version and inexplicably has the same model number so I had little confidence that I could pick the right listing on amazon and get the right headset from the 3rd party sellers so I bought mine on ebay where the seller confirmed he would send the 3.5mm version so pay attention when you buy!",5.0,WORKS with SKYPE for iPhone!!!

A3J3ZHGDUDPCFL,B00D2ZQ6ZI,fatmav,"[0, 0]","Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Rayovac PS73-4BT6 7-Hour Power Back Up for iPhones, Android, and Micro-USB Mobile Phones for review. Inside the box is the charger, a USB-to-microUSB cable, a USB-to-iPhone (old 30-pin standard, not lightning) cable, and four AA non-rechargable batteries. I don't have an iDevice so I have used the USB-to-microUSB cable only.The charger is very simple: it essentially is a battery case where you can put four AA batteries in serial (that's about 6V), and then it down-regulates the voltage to USB (5V). There is no on/off switch. You plug a USB cable into the charger's USB socket and it turns on; unplug and it turns off. There are two problems with the operation if I have to nitpick. 1. The charger turns on even if you have not connected a device on the other side. 2. When it turns on, there are three green LED on the charger to tell you how much juice your AA batteries have, and they are super bright Combining 1 and 2 means that you can potentially drain your AA batteries unintentionally.In actual usage, the amount of power it carries depends on your AA batteries. I have previously purchased an Energizer 3AA-to-USB charger B0093GIME8, and since that is a 3AA design, the running time is lower than this 4AA design. However, this also means the Energizer is more compact. A very reasonable tradeoff.The charger's construction feels a bit, urr, low-quality and the battery cover wobbles a bit more than I wish. I have not seen this grade of plastic in electronics for a long time. To give you a rough idea, I think all the TV remote controls I have handled in the last 10 years have a higher quality plastic than this. However, let me stress that this is enough to get the job done.Overall, if you are looking for a good 4AA-to-USB charger, this is a solid choice in terms of its one-and-only one feature.",5.0,Solid 4AA to USB or Apple-30pin charger at a reasonable price,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",courtesy of the amazon vine program i have received a rayovac psbt hour power back up for iphones android and microusb mobile phones for review inside the box is the charger a usbtomicrousb cable a usbtoiphone old pin standard not lightning cable and four aa nonrechargable batteries i dont have an idevice so i have used the usbtomicrousb cable onlythe charger is very simple it essentially is a battery case where you can put four aa batteries in serial thats about v and then it downregulates the voltage to usb v there is no onoff switch you plug a usb cable into the chargers usb socket and it turns on unplug and it turns off there are two problems with the operation if i have to nitpick  the charger turns on even if you have not connected a device on the other side  when it turns on there are three green led on the charger to tell you how much juice your aa batteries have and they are super bright combining  and  means that you can potentially drain your aa batteries unintentionallyin actual usage the amount of power it carries depends on your aa batteries i have previously purchased an energizer aatousb charger bgime and since that is a aa design the running time is lower than this aa design however this also means the energizer is more compact a very reasonable tradeoffthe chargers construction feels a bit urr lowquality and the battery cover wobbles a bit more than i wish i have not seen this grade of plastic in electronics for a long time to give you a rough idea i think all the tv remote controls i have handled in the last  years have a higher quality plastic than this however let me stress that this is enough to get the job doneoverall if you are looking for a good aatousb charger this is a solid choice in terms of its oneandonly one feature,joy,joy

A1EA5OZDASEEMY,B000BD3210,Andytech,"[1, 1]","I got this headset last week Wednesday and have been using it ever since.  I read a lot of reviews and found as much information as I could about this before even ordering it.  And after reading very mixed reviews, I just had to find out for myself.So here it is:I use it with my Motorola Q, which is also not a bad phone, and it works perfectly fine with it.  It paired up without any problems and stays connected when you want it to stay connected.  I have not had the opportunity to really test out the battery life yet, but I have tested it for approx 2 hours in between charges and it holds up fine for 2 hours.Incoming sound quality is perfect.  Actually a little too loud, but you can just lower the volume.Outgoing sound is also much better according my girlfriend who has heard me on my previous Sony HBH-660, and she says that the sound quality is much better.  Even when I have my windows rolled down going 65, she says she can hear me fine, although she says it sounds like I have the faucet running.  So I do question how the DSP itself works since it doesn't really filter out the windnoise.The system itself is pretty sleek and gives you multiple charging options.  So there should be no worry of running out of battery unless you talk consistently for more than 3 hours at a time.One gripe I do have is the button and the plastic.  The button should be easier to press and should require as much pressure as it does.  The plastic seems kind of cheap, which is probably what makes the thing so light, you barely even notice you have it on.

AH71FZZTUMGKQ,B00IL7B2YM,Sheldon Botha,"[2, 2]","So first up for the mod....you buy these, you go buy some Comply foam ear tips, makes the needed difference to get these perfect.Now I own the JayBird bluebud X's, and they really are a nice headset (yes I have comply ear tips on them and everything else I use as well), they are super super clear sounding, just insanely so.The Jaybirds are lighter, have a longer run time per charge, are smaller and play really clear for a wireless headset, I love them.The jabra rox is heavier, more solidly built (or so it feels), bigger but with a more full sound, and a couple hours less play time.I would equate the 2 against each other like this:The JayBird's are the Dynaudio mid ranges of the world(if you have ever heard these, dang are they crystal clear), the Jabra's are the Hertz Hi-Energy mid-ranges (clear with that missing bass and mid-range frequency that makes the music more full and complete, especially with music like Rock), if you have ever heard the 2 playing side by side, you know what I mean.The Jabra's have far more bass, not overly so, but it's got a good punch and sounds sooooo good.I noticed some more break up now and then on the Jabra's vs the JayBird's, but am not sure if it was just co-incidence or my phone.... (also maybe Bluetooth 4 vs 2.1?)The buttons are &#34;okay&#34;, not very &#34;clicky&#34; but once you get used to them it is no issue at all.The Jaybirds I think as far as fitment is concerned are slightly more comfortable, I think this may be due to the weight as well as the &#34;ear wings&#34; vs those on the Jabra's, but for the sound difference for the music I listen to, I am finding myself using the Jabra's more, and carrying the Bluebud X's as a backup in my bag.I nearly didn't purchase this item due to some reviews I read when they first got released, luckily there are a lot more reviews now that got me to take the risk of purchase, I am glad that I did.For a over all rich sounding, solid headset that I can wear for the 2 hour train ride I have each way everyday, these really do the trick, they are well sealed at high volumes, not leaking out much, if any audio at all, and that magnetic sleep function is just brilliant, what a great easy to use system that is functional and useful.I would highly recommend these and don't think you would regret this purchase.-Sheldon",5.0,Really really like these with a simply mod....,1402876800,"06 16, 2014",so first up for the modyou buy these you go buy some comply foam ear tips makes the needed difference to get these perfectnow i own the jaybird bluebud xs and they really are a nice headset yes i have comply ear tips on them and everything else i use as well they are super super clear sounding just insanely sothe jaybirds are lighter have a longer run time per charge are smaller and play really clear for a wireless headset i love themthe jabra rox is heavier more solidly built or so it feels bigger but with a more full sound and a couple hours less play timei would equate the  against each other like thisthe jaybirds are the dynaudio mid ranges of the worldif you have ever heard these dang are they crystal clear the jabras are the hertz hienergy midranges clear with that missing bass and midrange frequency that makes the music more full and complete especially with music like rock if you have ever heard the  playing side by side you know what i meanthe jabras have far more bass not overly so but its got a good punch and sounds sooooo goodi noticed some more break up now and then on the jabras vs the jaybirds but am not sure if it was just coincidence or my phone also maybe bluetooth  vs the buttons are okay not very clicky but once you get used to them it is no issue at allthe jaybirds i think as far as fitment is concerned are slightly more comfortable i think this may be due to the weight as well as the ear wings vs those on the jabras but for the sound difference for the music i listen to i am finding myself using the jabras more and carrying the bluebud xs as a backup in my bagi nearly didnt purchase this item due to some reviews i read when they first got released luckily there are a lot more reviews now that got me to take the risk of purchase i am glad that i didfor a over all rich sounding solid headset that i can wear for the  hour train ride i have each way everyday these really do the trick they are well sealed at high volumes not leaking out much if any audio at all and that magnetic sleep function is just brilliant what a great easy to use system that is functional and usefuli would highly recommend these and dont think you would regret this purchasesheldon,joy,joy

A2DVI9IJSG1D2G,B005SUHPO6,"Maddely ""So many books, so little time""","[0, 0]","OK, my original review is below. I'm updating this because I've had the case for about 5 mos. now and it's not as great as I thought it would be, which is why I've dropped from 5 stars to 4. The protection lives up to its reputation because I have dropped it many times and my phone is not damaged in any way. There are 2 parts to this case- the inner, hard plastic then the outer, rubber covering. Well, the hard plastic case is fine, it's the rubber one that hasn't lasted. The port covers immediately started breaking and eventually falling off, which made the rubber loose and annoying and then more pieces falling off since it was so loose. My previous case was also an Otterbox and it also had the same issue but didn't start falling apart until many months later... maybe a year...? With this new case it lasted much less longer. Turns out others I know, with the exact same case, color and all, is also in the same bad shape. What a disappointment. I'm currently looking for another case and in the meantime still using this Otterbox.Wasn't expecting much change from this Otterbox for the iPhone 4s compared to the last one I had, which was the just 1 previous version before for the iPhone 4. But I like this one so much more! The outer rubber case has a much tighter fit and makes the phone a tiny bit smaller & sleeker than the last case did. It just seems less bulky. Also, the tighter fit is is especially nice in all the port flaps that now have a nice, tight close! It also has a better feel for me in it's texture compared to the last one-- it feels more substantial- don't know why!? My phone has already been dropped at least twice and my phone is fine- just what I expected with the Otterbox protection. One last comment: love the color! No surprises when I got it- not much difference from what's shown on Amazon- you know how tricky color on a computer can be, but no surprises here and I would definitely recommend this case to anyone!

A1YEPFLLH42OU1,B00GLPYTCI,"Yu-Jin Chia ""Yu-Jin Chia""","[10, 11]","If you're looking at this, the first thing you're probably thinking is 'A totally free 4G wifi hotspot? Sounds too good to be true!'Well, it is. Do a bit of research first. If not, look for one of these on sale for $15, which happens from time to time. At that cost it's not a bad buy even if it just ends up being a fancy little paperweight. The two big caveats with FreedomPop's Photon are:1. The device uses Sprint's 4G wimax technology.2. The device has no 3G fallback.First, a brief history. Sprint's WiMax network used to be a company called Clearwire, which they owned a large amount of stock in and eventually bought outright for some unfathomable reason. To make a long story short the rollout of their WiMax network was aborted- for 'financial reasons' Sprint decided to halt it and instead go with LTE. As such, the WiMax network is incomplete and has an uncertain future.What this means for you (as a FreedomPop owner) is:1. Coverage in general is terrible. I live in Silicon Valley and even here it is very poor. If you live in the middle of nowhere, just forget it. The coverage maps, by the way, are a pretty poor reflection of reality (those assume the towers are all up, broadcasting at full power, not throttled, and are being maintained- all very big assumptions).2. Even if you have coverage, don't expect LTE or anything approaching broadband speed. The hardware and software for this network was never fully matured and will never be. I suspect it's also throttled in some areas- sure seems so to me.3. In all likelihood, this service's days are numbered. And that number is not very big.A more detailed explanation: since the rollout was never finished, there are a lot of dead spots- in fact pretty much the whole Midwest is one, and even heavily populated cities like San Francisco have really spotty coverage. This also means if you're using it on the go, FreedomPop will drop on and off and the battery will die in no time from constant attempts to reacquire signal.If there was 3G fallback on this device and it was still 500 MB a month for free, it would be a great deal as that would solve the coverage problem. Ditto for 4G LTE at no monthly fee. However, neither of these will EVER happen. Why? Well, as long as it's only using the Sprint WiMax network, it's not eating up anyone else's bandwidth. Sprint stopped selling devices using that network 2 years ago, and in all likelihood most of those are no longer being used- making Clearwire perhaps the most under-utilized 'national' network in human history. WiMax uses a different frequency from both 3G and 4G LTE, so Sprint is losing nothing farming out this network at little to no charge. However, if FreedomPop plugged into 3G or LTE, that's a different story- now you're eating up bandwidth that is also being used by Sprint customers- many of whom are paying $70 or more a month for service. Yeah, that's just not going to go for free and is why FreedomPop's hotspots with 3G fallback charge a monthly fee for any service.What irks me most about this device and which I find unforgivable is the marketing comparing it to hotspots offered by Verizon and AT&T; showing you saving some $1200 annually.

This case is designed to make your Note 2 more angular around the sides so the nice curve that helps the bigger than average Note 2 seat nicely in your hand is all but eliminated. This case actually adds extra bulk to the phone. Also because the case overextends all around, it completely dwarfs you s-pen slot making it almost impossible to slide out the s-pen if you have short trimmed nails.

""Gadget Geek""","[1, 1]","After failing to get an iPad WiFi 1st Generation open with a watch case knife (much too thick) and a 1.0mm thick nylon guitar pick (good for holding the screen up once popped loose, but not enough leverage to break it free from the clips initially), I came looking for tools and found this one with mostly positive reviews.I'll admit, when I opened the box upon its arrival, I was a little underwhelmed. True to their word, the tip does have any even thinner taper to it that makes wedging it between an iPad's back casing and the glass a fairly easy, but it felt thin and flimsy and I figured I could have just used a piece of stamped sheet metal from a local metal shop we have. However, after working with the iPad for several minutes, I found that there was one very big difference between this and just a plain piece of stamped metal, and that's the little padded grip. It seems like nothing when you first hold it, but that extra grip piece makes all the difference in being able to hold this tool fairly comfortably while applying leverage and pressure as you work. My hand still cramped after a bit (it was my first time opening an iPad, so it took me longer than the average YouTube instructional video), but it would have been horrible without that extra padding.The tool did bend a little more at the tip than I would have liked, but this tool is better suited for creating a gap so that you can then use some sort of plastic or nylon tool to apply additional leverage rather than using the iSesamo for all of your prying chores.

I've spent more than an hour on the phone trying to deal with the horrid customer service on different issues, and am now stymied because I can see the field where I should enter the required temporary password that came in the above text message, but I am somehow unable to type anything in that field, despite trying on an iPad and two different Android devices from different manufacturers.  The customer service phone number given in the manual does NOT connect you to the right people, and after slogging through an automated voice recognition system, you are connected to an operator who will connect you to the 4G phone service people, who will then tell you that they do not do hotspots, and send you to another person, who will then transfer you to yet another person, and eventually I find myself on hold long enough that I hang up and start over.  Before each transfer, the CSRs (who very obviously do not have English as their first language) read a lengthy script telling you that they are not the ones to solve your problem and another department does it, but they will transfer you to another department who will immediately solve my problem because my problem is so important to them, and T-Mobile is committed....blah, blah.  Before I abandoned my attempt (after over an hour, most of which was either on hold or listening to CSRs read soothing scripts that had nothing to do with solving my problem, I was interrupting the last CSR as he began his ""I'm going to transfer you...."" and asking, ""Just transfer me!"" and he would begin reading the script again from the beginning each time.  He did not understand what I was asking, and I'm sure he thought I was being a total jerk. After I spent a lengthy period of time on hold, I hung up.  I'm going to cool off for 24 hours, and give one more Boy Scout try at solving my problem.  If I don't succeed quickly, this will go back to Amazon.

I am in the military so I go through alot of terrian especially rucking through thick forest so I didnt feel comfortable using the clip of my waist for fear of a branch silently taking the phone without me noticing.

So the plastic screen protector started causing bubbles making it difficult for me to see what was on the screen so I peeled it off and put on an actual screen protector.

Lynn,"[0, 0]","I saw this product mentioned in another review and when a different dock I purchased didn't quite fit the bill, I investigated, then purchased this one, giving the other dock away as a gift since it wasn't going to suit my purposes. This one was everything I needed and then some. This has a fantastic, tight gripping system, which I need as I have a 4x4 Jeep and I don't always ride the smooth roadways. It holds both my Note2, as well as my S3 /with/ the Seidio Extended Battery case, which had ended up being my problem with the previous dock I mentioned earlier that I had to give away.The suction cup is extremely strong, and is thicker than the standard cup that you usually see on most docking stations providing a heavy duty seal that even after I yanked on it refused to budge. After your device is secured, you can rotate it, to whichever position you need, and still have complete piece of mind that it's not going anywhere.I had my own charging cable, so I can't speak to the charging capacity of the included one, and the paperwork stated that I would be mailed out the additional Aux cable at a later date. That aside, I will say that I would recommend this docking station to anyone who is looking for a solid, strong gripping docking station that has the ability to hold up in a vehicle that goes off-road. Even if you don't need something that strong, this is still a phenomenal docking station.  This is //not// one of those cheaply made mounts with little plastic pieces that feel brittle and thin.

It's a pain to keep a proprietary cable around for all the devices that decide to go non-standard. I was not pleased with this.Pairing was not difficult, though the name of the device was 4 numbers, no name or anything. I thought that was odd, and something simple that down-marketed the device in a way that was unnecessary and probably nearly free to correct.The speaker did play and operate easily and properly with a voice included in the unit to instruct you when to pair, when actions are happening or waiting, etc.The volume of the speaker wasn't as high as others I've used, and when the volume is near the top end it gets to a slight blare.

AHJ1JXHUSF4ZP,B00DUKJ5CQ,Amazon Customer,"[0, 0]","Physically this 12000mAh power pack gives a very rugged feel and look. I prefer this matte black finish to the shiny plastic (more delicate) look/feel of some other power packs. This pack is water, dirt and shock proof. Physically the device gives a nice feel for handling. It has four LEDs which is indicate its charging status and charge level. The case does not come with any bag/soft case unlike some other New Trent models. There is a flap/latch door on the device covers the three outlets for USB plugs. The device is not lightweight but to produce 12000 mAh, the size/weight is to be expected. You would not be carrying this in your pocket but carrying it in a backpack, larger bag, motorcycle or car would provide loads of power for all your devices such as smartphones, tablets, Bluetooth devices, GPS devices or anything else that needs charging. The device has loops in the case that would allow attachment to the outside of bags or packs.The pack charges with any generic micro USB cable/charger and a micro USB to USB cable is included. I was able to charge it with any universal micro USB charger. This is a great improvement over earlier New Trent devices that included a proprietary charger and made one additional device (charger) to take while traveling. The charging starts automatically when connected to a power source. I have read reviews that stated that you do not know the progress of charging. This is not correct as mentioned above. While charging the blue LEDs flash and stay on. Further the number of LEDs lit indicate the level of charge. When charging another device, the LEDs initially stay lit and tell you the level of charge (might be nice if the LEDs stayed lit the entire time when charging). The pack was cool to touch when being charged and never heated up.The ports seem well made. It has one for 1A (smartphones) and one for 2.1A (tablets). Well labeled on the protective flap and both ports can be used simultaneously. One charges a device by pressing the power button for a few seconds and the LEDs light up. I've successfully charged several smart phones, iPad, Bluetooth headsets, Garmin GPS device and Bluetooth remotes.The only other improvement I could recommend for the device itself, would be if there was a way to allow USB cables to be plugged in and to maintain it being waterproof. Perhaps some type of rubber gasket?It comes with a manual that includes all the information one needs. One small peeve, it that the type font is way too small in some sections to be easily read.I would highly recommend this power pack without reservations over other ones I have used (including other New Trents and Gomadic). I often travel on motorcycles/motorscooters and this is just the device needed. I can also see this for bicyclists and hikers needing protection for outdoor activities.

Unfortunately it does not come with a scratch shield as a previous reviewer mentioned, (at least mine didn&#8217;t), so that is an extra cost if it is needed.The case is a semi-hard polycarbonate, but lightweight. It is easy to hold on to with two slip resistant sides, and looks like it would offer good protection if dropped on the corner (I&#8217;m not going to test that out). I like how the buttons are covered up, yet are easy to press. The raised bezel offers a slight lip around the phone, but won&#8217;t offer much protection from a head on scratch, where a screen protector would. The holes at the bottom are aligned with easy connect &#8211; disconnect of the charging and headphone cables.I will miss the Apple logo being replaced by Thule&#8217;s top mounted logo, but I&#8217;d rather have the protection than a cracked case. Sure you are getting a good quality case here, backed by Thule&#8217;s 25 year warranty, but is it worth paying the premium price without getting full front and back protection?Oh, and one more thing, like another reviewer mentioned I think that the Product Description could be misleading if not read carefully enough regarding &#8220;fully submerged underwater use&#8221;.

Depending on what you're charging, it could last one charge or multiple days of charges. With my iPad and iPhone, I could usually use OXA Frosted for a few days before recharging it. There is also a &#34;power show button&#34; on the front with several lights that indicate when the battery is fully charged and how much charge it has left. Unlike other external batteries I've tried, this one actually charges devices fairly quickly - which is a plus if you just want to get a quick boost before running onto a plane!The variety of connectors that are included is a major plus.

The WAVE's earpiece is on a flexible shaft, but the distance between the earpiece and the top-of-the-ear curve is fixed.More Functions - The Motion has a number of voice-activated commands while the Wave is your basic earphone.Much better fidelity - There's no comparison when listening to music through the two headsets.

A22CW0ZHY3NJH8,B00HQZU8G8,Noname,"[0, 0]","I have always wanted to wear my phone on my wrist. Finally, there's a way to do it. I've found the Oxa Bluetooth watch useful when driving or when going someplace noisy where I can't hear my phone in my purse. It's good for any time holding a phone in my hand is not convenient.FORM FACTORMy wrist is small. This Bluetooth bracelet is not adjustable. I have to wear it higher up my arm to keep it still.The watch face is large and clunky, which is deceptive, because the digital display does not fill the screen. It's very small. In fact, I still can't tell what one of the icons is supposed to be.I can read the time (military time, we have no choice), but only if it is indoor lighting. Dimmer light is better. It's impossible to read outdoors, even in the shade.The watch charges with a proprietary cord that is very sensitive to being moved. I prefer the more universal micro USB cord. If I lose the charging cable, I would no longer be able to use my watch.BLUETOOTHIt was easy to pair with my iPhone 4S. Reconnection is automatic when I turn on the watch. Range is excellent. It is better than any other Bluetooth device that I own, which is a lot. When I go out of range, my watch vibrates to let me know a connection has been lost. If I come back within a short period (minutes), it will reconnect. If not, nothing happens.This watch is supposed to search for a signal every ten minutes. Not true.SOUNDIf you want to listen to music on your wrist, it's just okay. I don't think it was made for that. We get that small speaker quality.If you want to make and take calls, it's much better. My daughter helps me with a lot of my Bluetooth speakers, most of which have failed in the phone call department. This is the first one where the first words out of her mouth were, ""I love it!""I have to say, I can hear her and every other caller just fine on this watch. They come in loud and clear. No one ever asks me to repeat myself, either. I went and tried it out as a caller and found that there is a slight echo when I talk, but it's not bad enough to prevent a conversation.The one thing I would like for phone calls is a way to set the ring on vibrate. In fact, I'd like to be able to set the watch to vibrate only for texts and everything else. As it is, it will vibrate and ring for phone calls, and I get whatever tone the phone plays for messages.I'd like the texts to show on the face of the watch. Maybe they do. Most of the time, I'm in a place that's too bright for me to read the display.OVERALL IMPRESSIONI like the whole concept, and I like that the phone calls come in so clearly. I like being able to hold a conversation and I like the anti-theft or loss feature that vibrates when the phone is too far. I just wish the watch was smaller and the display was brighter and larger.This product was provided for review by Oxa.",3.0,Good for Calls On the Go,1396915200,"04 8, 2014",i have always wanted to wear my phone on my wrist finally theres a way to do it ive found the oxa bluetooth watch useful when driving or when going someplace noisy where i cant hear my phone in my purse its good for any time holding a phone in my hand is not convenientform factormy wrist is small this bluetooth bracelet is not adjustable i have to wear it higher up my arm to keep it stillthe watch face is large and clunky which is deceptive because the digital display does not fill the screen its very small in fact i still cant tell what one of the icons is supposed to bei can read the time military time we have no choice but only if it is indoor lighting dimmer light is better its impossible to read outdoors even in the shadethe watch charges with a proprietary cord that is very sensitive to being moved i prefer the more universal micro usb cord if i lose the charging cable i would no longer be able to use my watchbluetoothit was easy to pair with my iphone s reconnection is automatic when i turn on the watch range is excellent it is better than any other bluetooth device that i own which is a lot when i go out of range my watch vibrates to let me know a connection has been lost if i come back within a short period minutes it will reconnect if not nothing happensthis watch is supposed to search for a signal every ten minutes not truesoundif you want to listen to music on your wrist its just okay i dont think it was made for that we get that small speaker qualityif you want to make and take calls its much better my daughter helps me with a lot of my bluetooth speakers most of which have failed in the phone call department this is the first one where the first words out of her mouth were i love iti have to say i can hear her and every other caller just fine on this watch they come in loud and clear no one ever asks me to repeat myself either i went and tried it out as a caller and found that there is a slight echo when i talk but its not bad enough to prevent a conversationthe one thing i would like for phone calls is a way to set the ring on vibrate in fact id like to be able to set the watch to vibrate only for texts and everything else as it is it will vibrate and ring for phone calls and i get whatever tone the phone plays for messagesid like the texts to show on the face of the watch maybe they do most of the time im in a place thats too bright for me to read the displayoverall impressioni like the whole concept and i like that the phone calls come in so clearly i like being able to hold a conversation and i like the antitheft or loss feature that vibrates when the phone is too far i just wish the watch was smaller and the display was brighter and largerthis product was provided for review by oxa,joy,joy

A1UKA7HUAQAMY,B0054R1EY0,"Alison Hudson ""Ariamythe""","[0, 0]","I got ahold of this stylus after using the tiny, lightweight PoGo sketch for over a year. I like this stylus better than the PoGp -- it has a little more weight and heft to it (I can't stand no-weight writing instruments), not to mention a firmer sponge tip (I always hated the way the PoGo tip smushed and spread the second you touched the screen). The responsiveness is really good, and it glides nicely across my iPad's screen. I also like the burnished metal finish.My only complaint is a complaint that I think all the available styluses out there share: the tip is not pin-point accurate enough to handwrite with, or even to do precision sketching with.

A234V74W5JW277,B009P5WWPC,"Kyle ""cylem""","[6, 6]","Smartphone designers are always claiming that people are wanting slim phones and because of this it limits the size of battery they can put in it, which is usually like 2100 or less with a few exceptions. Then comes the razr maxx which has a miniscule added thickness compared to the Galaxy S3, One x, optimus G (infact I had the optimus G before this and they are almost exactly the same size). This keeps those good specs, thinness, and has a vastly larger battery.I'm big on batteries, usually when I get a phone, if i can I will get the extended battery for it, but that sucks you usually end up with something that's shaped like a cheese wedge and is awkward to hold. Not to mention the battery cover that comes with those third party batteries usually sucks and is more likely to break. I hate the thinking that I should be turning things off or I should wait to do something on my phone because I'm afraid it will die to soon. Who wants to go plug their phone in on lunch break or whenever they get in the car?The Razr Maxx in words is the phone for me (or you if you agree with the above paragraph) in terms of battery. Now I could slap a huge battery on an LG Chocolate but that wouldn't necessarily make it a good phone.Design:Decent design, especially looking at the previous Razr generation with their ugly chrome accent, it is really a decent looking phone. The front looks good with a great huge multicolored notification light. Sides are aluminum and the back is the Kevlar which is great and does not hold finger prints!It's heavier than your average phone, but it really makes it feel more solid and better in the hand. One annoyance though is you need a special tool to open the port for your sim card/micro sd. The sim card makes sense, by why the micro sd??Screen: Honestly they all mostly look the same, it looks good and works well in sunlight!Camera: Like other said, not the best but i think if people are that worried about the camera they should get a standalone. The camera works for facebook, video chat and picture messaging fine.Performance: Seems to be up there with the others. I've used the S3, optimus, and one x and its comparable. I wish it had 2gb of ram but it doesn't make a huge difference. I get slowdowns sometimes, using chrome it lags starting up, and typing sometimes lags behind when doing things, a few hicups here and there but nothing major.Software: Like said before, mostly stock, I didn't like the homepage they had, it was kind of slow and the homescreens were oddly set with swiping to the left giving me a power management access thing, so i just use NOVA. I am not a huge fan of the digital home, back, multitask buttons I would rather have them below the screen but its not a huge annoyance.Battery: Like I said this is why I got it, the battery is great, I'm at like the 7 hour mark with around 2 hours screen time probably, maybe a little less and it is at 75% which is leaps and bounds above most. I would be around 30% or less with 2 hours and a workdays amount of standby with my optimus G.I would recommend this to anyone who feels like I do about battery life, looking for great build quality and good specs. It may not be the fastest, the thinnest, best screen or best camera but all those things it still does great, along with keeping you alive all day during them.UPDATE: After a few more days of use, I have found the battery standby to not be as good as the LG Optimus and its newer processor. It seems that the newer Krait quad cores have great standby, not to say this ones is bad. However I do notice how much better the MAXX's battery is when using it, I tried Netflix and got i think a bit above an hour per 10% which is awesome.I still notice performance dips here and there, i downloaded Ram manager pro and it's helped, there is a decent amount of bloatware on the phone that is always loaded into my memory taking up alot of it. For instance it won't let me get rid of Slacker, I uninstall it and it redownloads, I get rid of it with root manager and it keeps popping up with errors.I love the feel of the phone more every day and love still not having to worry about my battery!",4.0,Really shows what some good design and engineering can do.

I've found it to be often the case that these manufacturers ""almost"" tell you how to pair their product, and you have to sort out the details on your own.

What it means is to depress AND RELEASE the volume buttons, then it pairs.The E200 uses the same USB-microUSB cable as many other devices, including Kindles and Kindle Fires. A cable is included, but it you are already using another one for other purposes you can keep the one provided with this device put away as a spare.In placing a call, the person I was talking too reported that they could hear me clearly and with sufficient volume. However, even with the E200 at top volume I thought that it was just a bit low. It certainly was not the same volume I get with my land-line receiver, my iPhone held up to my ear, or other blue tooth head/hand sets I've used.

A3MPOPREPBPUR9,B0027FFZEW,Good Times,"[2, 2]","I'm the type to research anything and everything before I buy, so of course I spent quite a bit of time reading and watching reviews of both the Voyager Pro and the Discovery 975. After much debate, I decided to go with the Pro, and I am so glad I did... It's amazing!I decided on the Pro, because I wanted a 'behind the ear' design for both optimal comfort and stability. Also, my research shows that the Pro has the upper hand when it came to straight audio performance. It excels in both areas. Here are some of my thoughts and impressions on different aspects of the device.First, the size and fit... Do NOT worry about the size of the device. It appears much larger and more intimidating in photos than it is in person. It's actually a very comfortable, manageable size. When it's on your ear, it doesn't seem out of place. It seems appropriate and looks quite nice and professional. The behind the ear design means that the device is VERY stable. Once it's in place, I can move freely about with no fear that it will fall out. I can swing my head around in all directions, and I never feel as though it's going to fall out.It's also VERY comfortable. I totally agree with other reviewers who say they forget that they're wearing it. Very easy to do. It is very light... Barely over half an ounce, it is barely noticeable at all. It is perfectly balanced, so it doesn't flop or pull in any direction. It feels solid and I completely forget that I have it on. I've worn it for several hours at a time at work, and don't even feel it. It has never made my ear sore, nor the inside of my ear. The ear bud fittings are completely comfortable.Second, the buttons and features... Do NOT worry about the placement of the on/off switch, as some reviewers have mentioned. It is on the rear of the ear piece, and once you get used to it, it is easy to find and press. The volume buttons are on top, and are very naturally placed and easy to use. And the answer button is on the outside of the ear bud, very commonly placed like many bluetooth devices... In my opinion, I would prefer the answer button to be on top, but that's my personal preference.You can answer a call with one short press, and hang up the call with one short press. You can also long press and use voice activation to make a call, if your phone offers that ability. Or, you can long press when a call comes in to automatically refuse the call and send it to voicemail. You can short press twice to automatically redial the last number.Once your on a call, you can mute the call and hear an audible confirmation say 'Mute On' or 'Mute Off'. You can also switch between the headset and the phone easily. And you can pair the headset with more than one device. The volume goes louder than most other headsets I've tried. That, plus the design of the ear bud, plus the superior sound quality means that volume should not be an issue for you. It is plenty loud enough for me.Also, the battery lasts a LONG time. 90 minutes will fully charge the battery, and you get 6 hours of talk time. I don't have any issues running out of battery. Plus, when it does get low, the device notifies you with a voice that says 'Battery Low' and 'Recharge Battery'Third, sound quality and performance... It's amazing, plain and simple. The call quality is truly second to none. I was very impressed once I heard it for myself. When I'm on the headset, people tell me they can't tell. They always say I sound great, and don't cut in or out. And the best part is the wind/noise cancellation abilities. When I'm in the car with wind/road noise, my voice still sounds clear to them. Plus, callers always sound great to me, despite the noise conditions where they're at. It simply out performs any other headsets I've tried. And for this price, it is a steal.At Best Buy the Voyager Pro will cost you 99.00, but I got mine from my local Fry's store for 69.00 and paid an additional 11.00 for a two year, in store, replacemente warranty if it ever breaks. So my 81.00 investment is still cheaper than B.B. So, you should definitely grab one at this price. I would easily pay 99.00 for one if I had to, no hesitations.If you're debating between the Voyager Pro and the Discovery 975, then my research shows that although the 975 is newer, and offers a few more features with voice commands, the Pro still has the superior audio performance. Also, the 975 is not a behind the ear design, so it is less stable than the Pro. Plus the 975 is 60.00 more than the Pro. So, just truse me and get this. The Plantronics Voyager Pro is the best bluetooth of all the high end ones that I or any of my friends has, or has had, hands down.Hope this was helpful...*** UPDATE: JAN 2011 ***My girlfriend just bought the Discovery 975 yesterday, and we spent a couple hours testing it against my Voyager Pro for sound quality. Hands down, the Voyager Pro is completely superior!The noise cancelling, and wind reduction is noticeably better on my Pro. We tested them standing in front of a fan and air conditioner... Both blocked all the noise when you're not talking, but the 975 had interference when talking in the wind. The Pro was far better.We also tested it near a faucet and running water. Same noticeable difference... The 975 was particularly noisy and hard to listen to when near running water. The Pro blocked it out nicely.Outside near heavy traffic, also the same. The Pro was hands down superior. Also with heavy breathing and yawning. We were both really disappointed. She was hoping the 975 would be great because she can't wear the Pro comfortably because of her ear. She is returning it today and sticking with her old one.So, it's true what the professional reviewers say about the Pro having superior sound quality. All my testing proves the same.Hope that helps...",5.0,Amazing...

plantronics voyager pro is the best bluetooth of all the high end ones that i or any of my friends has or has had hands downhope this was helpful update jan  my girlfriend just bought the discovery  yesterday and we spent a couple hours testing it against my voyager pro for sound quality hands down the voyager pro is completely superiorthe noise cancelling and wind reduction is noticeably better on my pro we tested them standing in front of a fan and air conditioner both blocked all the noise when youre not talking but the  had interference when talking in the wind the pro was far betterwe also tested it near a faucet and running water same noticeable difference the  was particularly noisy and hard to listen to when near running water the pro blocked it out nicelyoutside near heavy traffic also the same the pro was hands down superior also with heavy breathing and yawning we were both really disappointed she was hoping the  would be great because she cant wear the pro comfortably because of her ear she is returning it today and sticking with her old oneso its true what the professional reviewers say about the pro having superior sound quality all my testing proves the samehope that helps,joy,joy

Solid, smooth feel, much more on the nap-free suede side than traditional Top-Grain texured leather. I was joking with my brother about the ""Top Cowhide Leather"" description on the packaging tag (not ""Top-Grain Cowhide Leather, but just ""Top"")- like how there are different euphemistic names for ""Flank Steak"", and although it's still steak, it's definitely flank steak no matter what you call it.In this case, I believe ""Top Cowhide"" doesn't refer to Top-Grain but what is also known as ""Split Leather"", the 2nd top part that is left over after the Top-Grain itself is removed, and is characterized by the smooth, almost fuzzy feel, which can be processed further to make actual suede.

A3R19YKNL641X3,B00JWY5TRY,"Thomas Duff ""Duffbert""","[0, 0]","I recently received and tested a very nice Apple charging cable that's a step above the mass-produced (&#34;cheap&#34;) versions... the K-ble Ultra Series 10ft USB data sync and charge cable. A number of my cheap cables end up showing wear and tear (especially around the connectors) in fairly short order. The K-ble avoids this by having much sturdier connector points, as well as a thicker, higher quality cable. I can tell this cable will last much longer than my other ones.Another great feature is the length (10 ft as stated in the product title). If I want to use my iPad while connected to a charging plug, the options can be limited (depending on where the outlet is located). The 10 ft range on this cable means I can move around much more easily, and the odds of being able to use the device and remain plugged in improve dramatically over the standard 3 ft or 6 ft cables).The only thing I noticed is that the charging speed is somewhat slower with this cable than with a shorter/thinner cable. Not being an electronics geek, I'm going to assume it's due to 1) the additional length, and 2) the heavier cable causing a bit more resistance for the power flow. Even so, the speed difference wasn't overly problematic, and it was more than offset by the construction and convenience factors.You may not need a 10 ft cable if you're simply using the charger in the car. But if you want something with more range and/or that's more sturdy, this would be the way to go.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free",5.0,Sturdy construction and great range...,1400371200,"05 18, 2014",i recently received and tested a very nice apple charging cable thats a step above the massproduced cheap versions the kble ultra series ft usb data sync and charge cable a number of my cheap cables end up showing wear and tear especially around the connectors in fairly short order the kble avoids this by having much sturdier connector points as well as a thicker higher quality cable i can tell this cable will last much longer than my other onesanother great feature is the length  ft as stated in the product title if i want to use my ipad while connected to a charging plug the options can be limited depending on where the outlet is located the  ft range on this cable means i can move around much more easily and the odds of being able to use the device and remain plugged in improve dramatically over the standard  ft or  ft cablesthe only thing i noticed is that the charging speed is somewhat slower with this cable than with a shorterthinner cable not being an electronics geek im going to assume its due to  the additional length and  the heavier cable causing a bit more resistance for the power flow even so the speed difference wasnt overly problematic and it was more than offset by the construction and convenience factorsyou may not need a  ft cable if youre simply using the charger in the car but if you want something with more range andor thats more sturdy this would be the way to godisclosureobtained from manufacturerpayment free,joy,joy

A145B8OHVNNFAJ,B00BFQ9R0W,Steward Willons,"[0, 1]","Full disclosure: I was given a free product to review. This did affect my judgment of its performance or my review.The Bolse High Output Quad Port USB Charger works great, at least for me. A number of the other reviews indicate that there appears to be a fairly high rate of failure among these units, so perhaps quality control is not Bolse's strong suit. In my experience, however, everything functions perfectly.I don't have any Samsung products, so I couldn't test the charging capabilities of that port, but I do own an iPad, iPod, and iPhone, and the Bolse worked just fine with all of them. I'm not sure that it is substantively faster than charging with the standard Apple wall charger, but it does give you the option of charging multiple devices from one single outlet.When might this be useful? After all, it's not like every outlet in my apartment is full. I'm picturing myself using this when traveling. It's rare to find more than a few free outlets in hotel rooms, and if you're traveling with someone who also has devices to charge, it can be difficult to make sure everyone is covered. Provided you've remember the correct cables, the Bolse is an economic way to ensure that your batteries are all set to go in the morning.The unit feels well built and fairly durable. As some reviewers indicate, the electronics inside may be faulty, but the casing ought to withstand normal wear and tear. A blue LED is illuminated when you plug the unit into the wall. This looks pretty cool, although it's really bright when all the lights are off. Since I typically charge my phone at night, it's sort of like having a powerful blue nightlight. This is okay for me, but if you prefer total darkness, you may want to put some heavy tape over the LED.I have no real complaints.

When I bought it, it was Prime eligible but at the time of writing it is no more.I have the unmodified Galaxy S4 and wanted to add a little more since there was only one other review which stated they had the waterproof version.The biggest concern I had when buying this was adding bulk and causing a bulge in the battery cover.

I had one with the clear plastic that covered the whole case but it was always hard for me to actually make the screen work or access buttons so I was looking for one that was more like a regular case with a band around it for working out indoors or outdoors when it's not raining and this one fit the bill perfectly.  I have really small arms, my biceps are just over 10 inches (don't laugh I'm working on it!) and it fits just fine. I still have to tuck a little of the band behind the phone but it's not that difficult to do. For kicks I tried putting it on my thigh which is 17 inches (again, don't laugh) and it still fits, just barely, but it fits. So if you have small or large arms, my guess is this will still work for you.Also, the rubber that covers the volume and power buttons make it super easy to use those controls, better than if it did not have the case on it in fact.

I had thought originally that by just placing an item on it, it would charge. Clearly, I'm not that scientific, because that is not at all how it works. You need to plug something into the power source on your device, then magnetically connect another thing to that which connects with the grid. Interesting idea, but the way they went about it is pretty much useless.So, this kit, isn't cheap right? you'd think you you could charge multiple items by getting just this kit. but no, its a ""starter"" kit. This is not the price point of a starter kit in my opinion. For what its going for, it should have the connecter for 4 items, not 1. Not only that, it only works with a small variety of items. My personal cell phone from Virgin Mobile is not one of them.For what you pay, you might as well just continue to plug your phone or device in the traditional way. You take up too much square footage using this to charge one thing then you do just using the wire. And beyond that, it seems it might suck more power then just one small thing plugged in.

AUEY946M1L939,B00C13YSIO,"John L Murphy ""Fionnch""","[1, 1]","After 260+ reviews preceding mine, I wanted to emphasize a few points distinguishing this from the many competitors. Now that many newer Android smartphones follow the iPhone route and close off a battery compartment, external chargers appear to be gaining in necessity. This Maxboost 10000 mAn Dual-port 3A Premium USB Portable External Battery differs from other chargers, in my experience, five ways.1) It's heftier. Over about half a pound at least. It's more rugged, on the other hand, as a trade-off. Probably too heavy for a pocket, but in a pouch, backpack or luggage, a better fit.2) It's readable. The blue LED as the product description displays above makes this more precise in its readout in bigger black letters on a brighter blue background. This allows more precision as to estimating (the claim is to 1%) how much or how little of a charge is needed.3) It's laid out thoughtfully. The added flashlight button is easily turned on (and &#34;off&#34; needs as the helpful instructions remind you, just an added push for a short time) as an added bonus. It's easy to hold in the hand with its curved shape rather than a brick like other chargers, and so it fits well into the palm.4) Mini-USB and an Apple-compatible plug are provided as options and a small case is also sent along, a thoughtful touch. Finally, the dual ports for 2.1 tablet or 1 phone are engraved with their respective entries. This may be harder to make out in the dark as it's black on black, but it does not wear away easily.5) As the comments you can find here show, Maxboost is attentive to customer feedback. Earlier reviewers appear to have had some problems with devices. But later ones appear not to (I was sent this to evaluate fairly), and this to me indicates a responsive company to support.",5.0,Five reasons this stands apart from other chargers,1390694400,"01 26, 2014",after  reviews preceding mine i wanted to emphasize a few points distinguishing this from the many competitors now that many newer android smartphones follow the iphone route and close off a battery compartment external chargers appear to be gaining in necessity this maxboost  man dualport a premium usb portable external battery differs from other chargers in my experience five ways its heftier over about half a pound at least its more rugged on the other hand as a tradeoff probably too heavy for a pocket but in a pouch backpack or luggage a better fit its readable the blue led as the product description displays above makes this more precise in its readout in bigger black letters on a brighter blue background this allows more precision as to estimating the claim is to  how much or how little of a charge is needed its laid out thoughtfully the added flashlight button is easily turned on and off needs as the helpful instructions remind you just an added push for a short time as an added bonus its easy to hold in the hand with its curved shape rather than a brick like other chargers and so it fits well into the palm miniusb and an applecompatible plug are provided as options and a small case is also sent along a thoughtful touch finally the dual ports for  tablet or  phone are engraved with their respective entries this may be harder to make out in the dark as its black on black but it does not wear away easily as the comments you can find here show maxboost is attentive to customer feedback earlier reviewers appear to have had some problems with devices but later ones appear not to i was sent this to evaluate fairly and this to me indicates a responsive company to support,joy,joy

A2XA8CW5DF4MNZ,B001GD87QO,"Iron Man ""JON""","[2, 4]","Never used a Jabra before. I have been a constant user of Plantronics Bluetooth headsets ever since Bluetooth headsets appearing en masse and I consider them among the best out there. This is the first time I will be using a Jabra brand.First off, I like the design of this Bluetooth device. With a variety of gels and hooks for the ears, you can be assured of a comfort and exact fit. I especially like the hooks where it doesn't get in the way even if you are wearing a hat or eyeglasses. Unlike the thick hooks of the current Plantronics brand I use, Jabra's ear hooks are well molded. The different-sized ear gels are also another great advantage to ensure a secure fit and it is very comfortable. I even forget I am wearing this when worn for an extended period of time.Set up and pairing wasn't a problem either. It didn't take long for my MyTouch 3G to find this device. Once paired, I took it for a test run. The sound quality of this device is superior to most headsets I have used. When in the car, I made a call and you can feel the noise-canceling feature of this device. The ambient background noise are instantly minimized when you are in a call. The noise canceling feature does its job even when the car radio is turned on. It doesn't block out the noise completely but minimizes it to a degree where you can have decent conversation even with ambient noise.Another plus feature is being able to utilize a car-charger and a USB charger. Very convenient if you are away from home and you need to get a quick charge for your device. I also notice that the battery has a very long stand-by time.Overall a great headset that I can highly recommend!",5.0,Great Performing Bluetooth Headset!,1268870400,"03 18, 2010",never used a jabra before i have been a constant user of plantronics bluetooth headsets ever since bluetooth headsets appearing en masse and i consider them among the best out there this is the first time i will be using a jabra brandfirst off i like the design of this bluetooth device with a variety of gels and hooks for the ears you can be assured of a comfort and exact fit i especially like the hooks where it doesnt get in the way even if you are wearing a hat or eyeglasses unlike the thick hooks of the current plantronics brand i use jabras ear hooks are well molded the differentsized ear gels are also another great advantage to ensure a secure fit and it is very comfortable i even forget i am wearing this when worn for an extended period of timeset up and pairing wasnt a problem either it didnt take long for my mytouch g to find this device once paired i took it for a test run the sound quality of this device is superior to most headsets i have used when in the car i made a call and you can feel the noisecanceling feature of this device the ambient background noise are instantly minimized when you are in a call the noise canceling feature does its job even when the car radio is turned on it doesnt block out the noise completely but minimizes it to a degree where you can have decent conversation even with ambient noiseanother plus feature is being able to utilize a carcharger and a usb charger very convenient if you are away from home and you need to get a quick charge for your device i also notice that the battery has a very long standby timeoverall a great headset that i can highly recommend,joy,joy
AGXMC3ITWZASE,B001DETCUG,JDP,"[1, 1]","Over the years I've owned several headsets including the Plantronics 510. When I took the Plantronics Voyager 520 for a test drive last week the first two things that stood out immediately was the overall comfort and the superb call quality. Even outside on a windy day, performance was better then I expected.Pairing up to both my cell phone and PDA was a breeze. Mounted with a flexible silicone ear hook, rotating to either ear takes just seconds. The earpiece has nice comfortable feel to it. So comfortable in fact that on more then one occasion I forgot that I was wearing it.Outfitted with a multifunction toggle, I easily controlled the volume by sliding the toggle forward or back. Answering, disconnecting, transferring and last number redialing was done with the touch of the button. The only ping on this product is that sometimes the toggle feels a little stiff. The onboard LED flashes an intermittent blue when fully charged and continuously when in use. I get a red flashing signal when my battery is low and a pink flashing to remind me of missed calls.I like the fact that I can pair it with more than one piece of Bluetooth gear. When I was in a crowded grocery store the clarity of incoming and outgoing calls was outstanding. With my older 510 model I was unable to wear it in that environment because of its tendency to pick up almost every surrounding noise. Callers also noted the improved clarity even when I was outside on a windy day. My battery life on this feather weight model was about 7 hours in talk mode during the week and 2 days on the weekend.The Plantronics Voyager 520 comes with a charging cradle, instructions and a one year product warranty. The company's website is loaded with useful information and lists working toll free technical support phone numbers.Overall I am quite pleased with my Plantronics Voyager 520 Headset.

A18U49406IPPIJ,B007THAXB8,Deon,"[0, 0]","This Bluetooth headset is great for active users since they are sweat proof.Inside the box you will find all you need to have the perfect headset while working out. There is the headset itself, three pairs of ear gels, USB cord, and a velvet bag.The headsets are very light, almost weightless on the head. There is a very flat cord attaching them together. All of the functions are done on from the left ear, ranging from power/pairing and volume up/down. The charging port is hidden under a small flap on the top which makes for a clean design. The volume up/down buttons are on the bottom. The volume controls also doubles as play/pause & previous/next track.Having three pairs or ear gels (small, medium, large) to choose from, gives you a choice for an exact fit. The exterior of the ear gels are made of thin silicone that form to the contours of the ear, which enhances sound quality and blocks background noises.The microphone has great sound quality and allows for clear phone calls.When wearing these Bluetooth headsets it is best to wear them over the ear and tighten the straps to hold the back of the head. The best fit is to have them slightly tilted to the back, this will give the best wear and sound. The sound and call quality is great, being sweat proof is just a bonus.CONTENTS:Avanree Sacool Bluetooth HeadsetEar Gels: Small, Medium, Large (1 Pair Each)Micro USB Charging CableVelvet BagFEATURES:Bluetooth Version: 2.1Operating Rang: 33ft (10m)Battery Size: 120mAMusic Playback Time: Up To 6 hrs.Standby Time: Up To 120 hoursSize: 1.42 x 0.83 x 1.17in (36.2 x 21.2 x 29.7mm)Weight: 0.63oz (18g)Warranty: 1 YearI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.",5.0,Great Bluetooth Headset For Active Users,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",this bluetooth headset is great for active users since they are sweat proofinside the box you will find all you need to have the perfect headset while working out there is the headset itself three pairs of ear gels usb cord and a velvet bagthe headsets are very light almost weightless on the head there is a very flat cord attaching them together all of the functions are done on from the left ear ranging from powerpairing and volume updown the charging port is hidden under a small flap on the top which makes for a clean design the volume updown buttons are on the bottom the volume controls also doubles as playpause  previousnext trackhaving three pairs or ear gels small medium large to choose from gives you a choice for an exact fit the exterior of the ear gels are made of thin silicone that form to the contours of the ear which enhances sound quality and blocks background noisesthe microphone has great sound quality and allows for clear phone callswhen wearing these bluetooth headsets it is best to wear them over the ear and tighten the straps to hold the back of the head the best fit is to have them slightly tilted to the back this will give the best wear and sound the sound and call quality is great being sweat proof is just a bonuscontentsavanree sacool bluetooth headsetear gels small medium large  pair eachmicro usb charging cablevelvet bagfeaturesbluetooth version operating rang ft mbattery size mamusic playback time up to  hrsstandby time up to  hourssize  x  x in  x  x mmweight oz gwarranty  yeari was supplied a sample for the purpose of review,joy,joy

I don't have an i-Phone but it really doesn't matter, it works perfectly with my bluetooth enabled smart phone just fine.  Whenever I'm in the offie I keep my phone in a desktop charging cradle and have my wireless headset nearby.  But it is a hassle putting the headset on and off everytime I want to make or take a call.With the Moshi Curve (odd name for a product) my phone can remain in the cradle and I can make a call using a comfortable and familiar handset.  It is far easier to hold than a candy bar shaped phone and any radiation from the phone is far away from my ear.Since I don't have an iPhone I have found that the dock on the handset works perfectly with my iPod, it keeps it charged and there is a handy audio output to my computer speaker system.  It holds the iPod at the perfect angle and keeps it handy since the phone is close to me on my desk.I can't write this without commenting on the packaging the manufacturer used for this device.  Considering there is nothing really fragile about it, a normal blister card would have been fine, but no, it came packed in a box made of cardboard that is about 4x thicker than a normal box, with an intricately die-cut inner sleeve that has a piece of thick dense rubber surrounding the phone (!).  It was incredibly overpackaged, but certainly protected the device and gave the whole product an aura of quality.I read a review from someone who downgraded the product because of ""bright blinking lights"" and expected them to be visible and annoying.  In fact they are on the underside of the handset and not even visible in the daytime.  At night they put out a soft glow, not at all annoying.  I'm thinking most people who own this handset would use it at a desk or in their living area, not in a darkened bedroom, but if they did a little piece of tape over the light would take care of the problem and would be unseen so it wouldn't detract from the styling.  In my opinion, the status lights have nothing to do with whether this is a good product or not.So, is it a good product?  Yes.  It is extremely attractive and almost a piece of art (reminds of of Bang & Olufsen products).  The sound quality is better than the phone itself and it is substantially easier to hold for extended periods.

With two ports it can charge two devices at the same time. That's a big plus but also a bit of a minus if you're charging an iPad. An iPad tends to draw more current than most USB devices so you need to remember that only the #2 port can accommodate a high current device.Last year after Sandy hit I was stuck without power for about ten days. With only portable radios and my iPhone (fortunately loaded with books (both text and audio) as my only form of entertainment. I had two 120Ds that kept my iPhone charged for a good amount of the time. I was also fortunate enough to have friends with access to power that were able to charge them a couple times each. I now have six of the batteries.The first two that I owned were the early models that used an external charger. The other four are the newer models that will charge from any USB port. The newer ones are more convenient but unfortunately don't come with a charger. This really isn't a problem because I suspect most of us are drowning in USB chargers. If you don't have one, NewTrent has a nice, high power, dual port one here on Amazon for under $10.One great thing about the 12oD is the price. Under $40 for a 12000 mAh battery is quite a bargain! That's one reason I don't mind stocking up. The overall shape and weight make them easy to carry so you can always have one around in case of emergency.

I usually spend between 2-4 hours a day talking and an additional 2-4 hours a day checking and responding to emails.  When I am inside my office, I usually have a decreased signal strength, and my phone is constantly trying to connect to a network.

Nothing is more frustrating than getting the &#34;low battery&#34; pop up in the middle of a phone call or email.I used to always lug around multiple chargers; one for my bluetooth, one for my iPhone, one for my Fitbit, etc.  Now, all I have to do is carry this little guy around!

The print in the very brief (and very useful if you can read it) manual is SO tiny only the youngest users with 20/20 eyesight will be able to read it. I actually had to scan the manual at 600 dpi and then print it out in order to read the directions.Otherwise, this is a tiny power packed all-in-one speaker that can easily slip inside a standard coffee cup at 2.5"" tall and 2"" x 2"" square. It has a hefty feel and sits solidly on my desk. The sound is surprisingly punchy and doesn't sound like the $2-$3 super cheapies you can get at Dollar stores and their ilk. It should be obvious that this speaker isn't for the audiophile or for partying in the dorm room. But for me, it's a perfect accessory to carry around in general for use with my various laptops and tablets. None of my equipment has speakers that satisfy me. The OXA mini portable is perfect for giving me nice, clear, loud output for movies, videos, and the occasional music session. I have to confess that for music I almost always use headphones.I didn't have to read the manual to use the OXA Mini Portable in the first place. It hooked up to various friend's cell phones (iPhones AND androids) with no problems. However, when we went to adjust the volume, we found that button to be too close to the ""interrupt and use phone"" button so that we kept accidentally activating cell phone dialing out.I REALLY like this speaker and find it both cute (it's SOOOO tiny!) and useful.
